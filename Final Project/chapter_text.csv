Hunger Games Chapter 1,"When I wake up, the other side of the bed is cold. My fingers stretch out, seeking Prim's warmth but finding only the rough canvas cover of the mattress. She must have had bad dreams and climbed in with our mother. Of course, she did. This is the day of the reaping.  I prop myself up on one elbow. There's enough light in the bedroom to see them. My little sister, Prim, curled up on her side, cocooned in my mother's body, their cheeks pressed together. In sleep, my mother looks younger, still worn but not so beaten-down. Prim's face is as fresh as a raindrop, as lovely as the primrose for which she was named. My mother was very beautiful once, too. Or so they tell me.  Sitting at Prim's knees, guarding her, is the world's ugliest cat. Mashed-in nose, half of one ear missing, eyes the color of rotting squash. Prim named him Buttercup, insisting that his muddy yellow coat matched the bright flower. He hates me. Or at least distrusts me. Even though it was years ago, I think he still remembers how I tried to drown him in a bucket when Prim brought him home. Scrawny kitten, belly swollen with worms, crawling with fleas. The last thing I needed was another mouth to feed. But Prim begged so hard, cried even, I had to let him stay. It turned out okay. My mother got rid of the vermin and he's a born mouser. Even catches the occasional rat. Sometimes, when I clean a kill, I feed Buttercup the entrails. He has stopped hissing at me.  Entrails. No hissing. This is the closest we will ever come to love.  I swing my legs off the bed and slide into my hunting boots. Supple leather that has molded to my feet. I pull on trousers, a shirt, tuck my long dark braid up into a cap, and grab my forage bag. On the table, under a wooden bowl to protect it from hungry rats and cats alike, sits a perfect little goat cheese wrapped in basil leaves. Prim's gift to me on reaping day. I put the cheese carefully in my pocket as I slip outside.  Our part of District 12, nicknamed the Seam, is usually crawling with coal miners heading out to the morning shift at this hour. Men and women with hunched shoulders, swollen knuckles, many who have long since stopped trying to scrub the coal dust out of their broken nails, the lines of their sunken faces. But today the black cinder streets are empty. Shutters on the squat gray houses are closed. The reaping isn't until two. May as well sleep in. If you can.  Our house is almost at the edge of the Seam. I only have to pass a few gates to reach the scruffy field called the Meadow. Separating the Meadow from the woods, in fact enclosing all of District 12, is a high chain-link fence topped with barbed-wire loops. In theory, it's supposed to be electrified twenty-four hours a day as a deterrent to the predators that live in the woods  -  packs of wild dogs, lone cougars, bears  -  that used to threaten our streets. But since we're lucky to get two or three hours of electricity in the evenings, it's usually safe to touch. Even so, I always take a moment to listen carefully for the hum that means the fence is live. Right now, it's silent as a stone. Concealed by a clump of bushes, I flatten out on my belly and slide under a two-foot stretch that's been loose for years. There are several other weak spots in the fence, but this one is so close to home I almost always enter the woods here.  As soon as I'm in the trees, I retrieve a bow and sheath of arrows from a hollow log. Electrified or not, the fence has been successful at keeping the flesh-eaters out of District 12. Inside the woods they roam freely, and there are added concerns like venomous snakes, rabid animals, and no real paths to follow. But there's also food if you know how to find it. My father knew and he taught me some before he was blown to bits in a mine explosion. There was nothing even to bury. I was eleven then. Five years later, I still wake up screaming for him to run.  Even though trespassing in the woods is illegal and poaching carries the severest of penalties, more people would risk it if they had weapons. But most are not bold enough to venture out with just a knife. My bow is a rarity, crafted by my father along with a few others that I keep well hidden in the woods, carefully wrapped in waterproof covers. My father could have made good money selling them, but if the officials found out he would have been publicly executed for inciting a rebellion. Most of the Peacekeepers turn a blind eye to the few of us who hunt because they're as hungry for fresh meat as anybody is. In fact, they're among our best customers. But the idea that someone might be arming the Seam would never have been allowed.  In the fall, a few brave souls sneak into the woods to harvest apples. But always in sight of the Meadow. Always close enough to run back to the safety of District 12 if trouble arises. ""District Twelve. Where you can starve to death in safety,"" I mutter. Then I glance quickly over my shoulder. Even here, even in the middle of nowhere, you worry someone might overhear you.  When I was younger, I scared my mother to death, the things I would blurt out about District 12, about the people who rule our country, Panem, from the far-off city called the Capitol. Eventually I understood this would only lead us to more trouble. So I learned to hold my tongue and to turn my features into an indifferent mask so that no one could ever read my thoughts. Do my work quietly in school. Make only polite small talk in the public market. Discuss little more than trades in the Hob, which is the black market where I make most of my money. Even at home, where I am less pleasant, I avoid discussing tricky topics. Like the reaping, or food shortages, or the Hunger Games. Prim might begin to repeat my words and then where would we be?  In the woods waits the only person with whom I can be myself. Gale. I can feel the muscles in my face relaxing, my pace quickening as I climb the hills to our place, a rock ledge overlooking a valley. A thicket of berry bushes protects it from unwanted eyes. The sight of him waiting there brings on a smile. Gale says I never smile except in the woods.  ""Hey, Catnip,"" says Gale. My real name is Katniss, but when I first told him, I had barely whispered it. So he thought I'd said Catnip. Then when this crazy lynx started following me around the woods looking for handouts, it became his official nickname for me. I finally had to kill the lynx because he scared off game. I almost regretted it because he wasn't bad company. But I got a decent price for his pelt.  ""Look what I shot,"" Gale holds up a loaf of bread with an arrow stuck in it, and I laugh. It's real bakery bread, not the flat, dense loaves we make from our grain rations. I take it in my hands, pull out the arrow, and hold the puncture in the crust to my nose, inhaling the fragrance that makes my mouth flood with saliva. Fine bread like this is for special occasions.  ""Mm, still warm,"" I say. He must have been at the bakery at the crack of dawn to trade for it. ""What did it cost you?""  ""Just a squirrel. Think the old man was feeling sentimental this morning,"" says Gale. ""Even wished me luck.""  ""Well, we all feel a little closer today, don't we?"" I say, not even bothering to roll my eyes. ""Prim left us a cheese."" I pull it out.  His expression brightens at the treat. ""Thank you, Prim. We'll have a real feast."" Suddenly he falls into a Capitol accent as he mimics Effie Trinket, the maniacally upbeat woman who arrives once a year to read out the names at the leaping. ""I almost forgot! Happy Hunger Games!"" He plucks a few blackberries from the bushes around us. ""And may the odds  - "" He tosses a berry in a high arc toward me.  I catch it in my mouth and break the delicate skin with my teeth. The sweet tartness explodes across my tongue. "" -  be ever in your favor!"" I finish with equal verve. We have to joke about it because the alternative is to be scared out of your wits. Besides, the Capitol accent is so affected, almost anything sounds funny in it.  I watch as Gale pulls out his knife and slices the bread. He could be my brother. Straight black hair, olive skin, we even have the same gray eyes. But we're not related, at least not closely. Most of the families who work the mines resemble one another this way.  That's why my mother and Prim, with their light hair and blue eyes, always look out of place. They are. My mother's parents were part of the small merchant class that caters to officials, Peacekeepers, and the occasional Seam customer. They ran an apothecary shop in the nicer part of District 12. Since almost no one can afford doctors, apothecaries are our healers. My father got to know my mother because on his hunts he would sometimes collect medicinal herbs and sell them to her shop to be brewed into remedies. She must have really loved him to leave her home for the Seam. I try to remember that when all I can see is the woman who sat by, blank and unreachable, while her children turned to skin and bones. I try to forgive her for my father's sake. But to be honest, I'm not the forgiving type.  Gale spreads the bread slices with the soft goat cheese, carefully placing a basil leaf on each while I strip the bushes of their berries. We settle back in a nook in the rocks. From this place, we are invisible but have a clear view of the valley, which is teeming with summer life, greens to gather, roots to dig, fish iridescent in the sunlight. The day is glorious, with a blue sky and soft breeze. The food's wonderful, with the cheese seeping into the warm bread and the berries bursting in our mouths. Everything would be perfect if this really was a holiday, if all the day off meant was roaming the mountains with Gale, hunting for tonight's supper. But instead we have to be standing in the square at two o'clock waiting for the names to be called out.  ""We could do it, you know,"" Gale says quietly.  ""What?"" I ask.  ""Leave the district. Run off. Live in the woods. You and I, we could make it,"" says Gale.  I don't know how to respond. The idea is so preposterous.  ""If we didn't have so many kids,"" he adds quickly.  They're not our kids, of course. But they might as well be. Gale's two little brothers and a sister. Prim. And you may as well throw in our mothers, too, because how would they live without us? Who would fill those mouths that are always asking for more? With both of us hunting daily, there are still nights when game has to be swapped for lard or shoelaces or wool, still nights when we go to bed with our stomachs growling.  ""I never want to have kids,"" I say.  ""I might. If I didn't live here,"" says Gale.  ""But you do,"" I say, irritated.  ""Forget it,"" he snaps back.  The conversation feels all wrong. Leave? How could I leave Prim, who is the only person in the world I'm certain I love? And Gale is devoted to his family. We can't leave, so why bother talking about it? And even if we did. even if we did. where did this stuff about having kids come from? There's never been anything romantic between Gale and me. When we met, I was a skinny twelve-year-old, and although he was only two years older, he already looked like a man. It took a long time for us to even become friends, to stop haggling over every trade and begin helping each other out.  Besides, if he wants kids, Gale won't have any trouble finding a wife. He's good-looking, he's strong enough to handle the work in the mines, and he can hunt. You can tell by the way the girls whisper about him when he walks by in school that they want him. It makes me jealous but not for the reason people would think. Good hunting partners are hard to find.  ""What do you want to do?"" I ask. We can hunt, fish, or gather.  ""Let's fish at the lake. We can leave our poles and gather in the woods. Get something nice for tonight,"" he says.  Tonight. After the reaping, everyone is supposed to celebrate. And a lot of people do, out of relief that their children have been spared for another year. But at least two families will pull their shutters, lock their doors, and try to figure out how they will survive the painful weeks to come.  We make out well. The predators ignore us on a day when easier, tastier prey abounds. By late morning, we have a dozen fish, a bag of greens and, best of all, a gallon of strawberries. I found the patch a few years ago, but Gale had the idea to string mesh nets around it to keep out the animals.  On the way home, we swing by the Hob, the black market that operates in an abandoned warehouse that once held coal. When they came up with a more efficient system that transported the coal directly from the mines to the trains, the Hob gradually took over the space. Most businesses are closed by this time on reaping day, but the black market's still fairly busy. We easily trade six of the fish for good bread, the other two for salt. Greasy Sae, the bony old woman who sells bowls of hot soup from a large kettle, takes half the greens off our hands in exchange for a couple of chunks of paraffin. We might do a tad better elsewhere, but we make an effort to keep on good terms with Greasy Sae. She's the only one who can consistently be counted on to buy wild dog. We don't hunt them on purpose, but if you're attacked and you take out a dog or two, well, meat is meat. ""Once it's in the soup, I'll call it beef,"" Greasy Sae says with a wink. No one in the Seam would turn up their nose at a good leg of wild dog, but the Peacekeepers who come to the Hob can afford to be a little choosier.  When we finish our business at the market, we go to the back door of the mayor's house to sell half the strawberries, knowing he has a particular fondness for them and can afford our price. The mayor's daughter, Madge, opens the door. She's in my year at school. Being the mayor's daughter, you'd expect her to be a snob, but she's all right. She just keeps to herself. Like me. Since neither of us really has a group of friends, we seem to end up together a lot at school. Eating lunch, sitting next to each other at assemblies, partnering for sports activities. We rarely talk, which suits us both just fine.  Today her drab school outfit has been replaced by an expensive white dress, and her blonde hair is done up with a pink ribbon. Reaping clothes.  ""Pretty dress,"" says Gale.  Madge shoots him a look, trying to see if it's a genuine compliment or if he's just being ironic. It is a pretty dress, but she would never be wearing it ordinarily. She presses her lips together and then smiles. ""Well, if I end up going to the Capitol, I want to look nice, don't I?""  Now it's Gale's turn to be confused. Does she mean it? Or is she messing with him? I'm guessing the second.  ""You won't be going to the Capitol,"" says Gale coolly. His eyes land on a small, circular pin that adorns her dress. Real gold. Beautifully crafted. It could keep a family in bread for months. ""What can you have? Five entries? I had six when I was just twelve years old.""  ""That's not her fault,"" I say.  ""No, it's no one's fault. Just the way it is,"" says Gale. Madge's face has become closed off. She puts the money for the berries in my hand. ""Good luck, Katniss."" ""You, too,"" I say, and the door closes.  We walk toward the Seam in silence. I don't like that Gale took a dig at Madge, but he's right, of course. The reaping system is unfair, with the poor getting the worst of it. You become eligible for the reaping the day you turn twelve. That year, your name is entered once. At thirteen, twice. And so on and so on until you reach the age of eighteen, the final year of eligibility, when your name goes into the pool seven times. That's true for every citizen in all twelve districts in the entire country of Panem.  But here's the catch. Say you are poor and starving as we were. You can opt to add your name more times in exchange for tesserae. Each tessera is worth a meager year's supply of grain and oil for one person. You may do this for each of your family members as well. So, at the age of twelve, I had my name entered four times. Once, because I had to, and three times for tesserae for grain and oil for myself, Prim, and my mother. In fact, every year I have needed to do this. And the entries are cumulative. So now, at the age of sixteen, my name will be in the reaping twenty times. Gale, who is eighteen and has been either helping or single-handedly feeding a family of five for seven years, will have his name in forty-two times.  You can see why someone like Madge, who has never been at risk of needing a tessera, can set him off. The chance of her name being drawn is very slim compared to those of us who live in the Seam. Not impossible, but slim. And even though the rules were set up by the Capitol, not the districts, certainly not Madge's family, it's hard not to resent those who don't have to sign up for tesserae.  Gale knows his anger at Madge is misdirected. On other days, deep in the woods, I've listened to him rant about how the tesserae are just another tool to cause misery in our district. A way to plant hatred between the starving workers of the Seam and those who can generally count on supper and thereby ensure we will never trust one another. ""It's to the Capitol's advantage to have us divided among ourselves,"" he might say if there were no ears to hear but mine. If it wasn't reaping day. If a girl with a gold pin and no tesserae had not made what I'm sure she thought was a harmless comment.  As we walk, I glance over at Gale's face, still smoldering underneath his stony expression. His rages seem pointless to me, although I never say so. It's not that I don't agree with him. I do. But what good is yelling about the Capitol in the middle of the woods? It doesn't change anything. It doesn't make things fair. It doesn't fill our stomachs. In fact, it scares off the nearby game. I let him yell though. Better he does it in the woods than in the district.  Gale and I divide our spoils, leaving two fish, a couple of loaves of good bread, greens, a quart of strawberries, salt, paraffin, and a bit of money for each.  ""See you in the square,"" I say.  ""Wear something pretty,"" he says flatly.  At home, I find my mother and sister are ready to go. My mother wears a fine dress from her apothecary days. Prim is in my first reaping outfit, a skirt and ruffled blouse. It's a bit big on her, but my mother has made it stay with pins. Even so, she's having trouble keeping the blouse tucked in at the back.  A tub of warm water waits for me. I scrub off the dirt and sweat from the woods and even wash my hair. To my surprise, my mother has laid out one of her own lovely dresses for me. A soft blue thing with matching shoes.  ""Are you sure?"" I ask. I'm trying to get past rejecting offers of help from her. For a while, I was so angry, I wouldn't allow her to do anything for me. And this is something special. Her clothes from her past are very precious to her.  ""Of course. Let's put your hair up, too,"" she says. I let her towel-dry it and braid it up on my head. I can hardly recognize myself in the cracked mirror that leans against the wall.  ""You look beautiful,"" says Prim in a hushed voice.  ""And nothing like myself,"" I say. I hug her, because I know these next few hours will be terrible for her. Her first reaping. She's about as safe as you can get, since she's only entered once. I wouldn't let her take out any tesserae. But she's worried about me. That the unthinkable might happen.  I protect Prim in every way I can, but I'm powerless against the reaping. The anguish I always feel when she's in pain wells up in my chest and threatens to register on my (ace. I notice her blouse has pulled out of her skirt in the back again and force myself to stay calm. ""Tuck your tail in, little duck,"" I say, smoothing the blouse back in place.  Prim giggles and gives me a small ""Quack.""  ""Quack yourself,"" I say with a light laugh. The kind only Prim can draw out of me. ""Come on, let's eat,"" I say and plant a quick kiss on the top of her head.  The fish and greens are already cooking in a stew, but that will be for supper. We decide to save the strawberries and bakery bread for this evening's meal, to make it special we say. Instead we drink milk from Prim's goat, Lady, and eat the rough bread made from the tessera grain, although no one has much appetite anyway.  At one o'clock, we head for the square. Attendance is mandatory unless you are on death's door. This evening, officials will come around and check to see if this is the case. If not, you'll be imprisoned.  It's too bad, really, that they hold the reaping in the square  -  one of the few places in District 12 that can be pleasant. The square's surrounded by shops, and on public market days, especially if there's good weather, it has a holiday feel to it. But today, despite the bright banners hanging on the buildings, there's an air of grimness. The camera crews, perched like buzzards on rooftops, only add to the effect.  People file in silently and sign in. The reaping is a good opportunity for the Capitol to keep tabs on the population as well. Twelve- through eighteen-year-olds are herded into roped areas marked off by ages, the oldest in the front, the young ones, like Prim, toward the back. Family members line up around the perimeter, holding tightly to one another's hands. But there are others, too, who have no one they love at stake, or who no longer care, who slip among the crowd, taking bets on the two kids whose names will be drawn. Odds are given on their ages, whether they're Seam or merchant, if they will break down and weep. Most refuse dealing with the racketeers but carefully, carefully. These same people tend to be informers, and who hasn't broken the law? I could be shot on a daily basis for hunting, but the appetites of those in charge protect me. Not everyone can claim the same.  Anyway, Gale and I agree that if we have to choose between dying of hunger and a bullet in the head, the bullet would be much quicker.  The space gets tighter, more claustrophobic as people arrive. The square's quite large, but not enough to hold District 12's population of about eight thousand. Latecomers are directed to the adjacent streets, where they can watch the event on screens as it's televised live by the state.  I find myself standing in a clump of sixteens from the Seam. We all exchange terse nods then focus our attention on the temporary stage that is set up before the Justice Building. It holds three chairs, a podium, and two large glass balls, one for the boys and one for the girls. I stare at the paper slips in the girls' ball. Twenty of them have Katniss Everdeen written on them in careful handwriting.  Two of the three chairs fill with Madge's father, Mayor Undersee, who's a tall, balding man, and Effie Trinket, District 12's escort, fresh from the Capitol with her scary white grin, pinkish hair, and spring green suit. They murmur to each other and then look with concern at the empty seat.  Just as the town clock strikes two, the mayor steps up to the podium and begins to read. It's the same story every year. He tells of the history of Panem, the country that rose up out of the ashes of a place that was once called North America. He lists the disasters, the droughts, the storms, the fires, the encroaching seas that swallowed up so much of the land, the brutal war for what little sustenance remained. The result was Panem, a shining Capitol ringed by thirteen districts, which brought peace and prosperity to its citizens. Then came the Dark Days, the uprising of the districts against the Capitol. Twelve were defeated, the thirteenth obliterated. The Treaty of Treason gave us the new laws to guarantee peace and, as our yearly reminder that the Dark Days must never be repeated, it gave us the Hunger Games.  The rules of the Hunger Games are simple. In punishment for the uprising, each of the twelve districts must provide one girl and one boy, called tributes, to participate. The twenty-four tributes will be imprisoned in a vast outdoor arena that could hold anything from a burning desert to a frozen wasteland. Over a period of several weeks, the competitors must fight to the death. The last tribute standing wins.  Taking the kids from our districts, forcing them to kill one another while we watch  -  this is the Capitol's way of reminding us how totally we are at their mercy. How little chance we would stand of surviving another rebellion.  Whatever words they use, the real message is clear. ""Look how we take your children and sacrifice them and there's nothing you can do. If you lift a finger, we will destroy every last one of you. Just as we did in District Thirteen.""  To make it humiliating as well as torturous, the Capitol requires us to treat the Hunger Games as a festivity, a sporting event pitting every district against the others. The last tribute alive receives a life of ease back home, and their district will be showered with prizes, largely consisting of food. All year, the Capitol will show the winning district gifts of grain and oil and even delicacies like sugar while the rest of us battle starvation.  ""It is both a time for repentance and a time for thanks,"" intones the mayor.  Then he reads the list of past District 12 victors. In seventy-four years, we have had exactly two. Only one is still alive. Haymitch Abernathy, a paunchy, middle-aged man, who at this moment appears hollering something unintelligible, staggers onto the stage, and falls into the third chair. He's drunk. Very. The crowd responds with its token applause, but he's confused and tries to give Effie Trinket a big hug, which she barely manages to fend off.  The mayor looks distressed. Since all of this is being televised, right now District 12 is the laughingstock of Panem, and he knows it. He quickly tries to pull the attention back to the reaping by introducing Effie Trinket.  Bright and bubbly as ever, Effie Trinket trots to the podium and gives her signature, ""Happy Hunger Games! And may the odds be ever in your favor!"" Her pink hair must be a wig because her curls have shifted slightly off-center since her encounter with Haymitch. She goes on a bit about what an honor it is to be here, although everyone knows she's just aching to get bumped up to a better district where they have proper victors, not drunks who molest you in front of the entire nation.  Through the crowd, I spot Gale looking back at me with a ghost of a smile. As reapings go, this one at least has a slight entertainment factor. But suddenly I am thinking of Gale and his forty-two names in that big glass ball and how the odds are not in his favor. Not compared to a lot of the boys. And maybe he's thinking the same thing about me because his face darkens and he turns away. ""But there are still thousands of slips,"" I wish I could whisper to him.  It's time for the drawing. Effie Trinket says as she always does, ""Ladies first!"" and crosses to the glass ball with the girls' names. She reaches in, digs her hand deep into the ball, and pulls out a slip of paper. The crowd draws in a collective breath and then you can hear a pin drop, and I'm feeling nauseous and so desperately hoping that it's not me, that it's not me, that it's not me.  Effie Trinket crosses back to the podium, smoothes the slip of paper, and reads out the name in a clear voice. And it's not me.  It's Primrose Everdeen."
Hunger Games Chapter 2,"One time, when I was in a blind in a tree, waiting motionless for game to wander by, I dozed off and fell ten feet to the ground, landing on my back. It was as if the impact had knocked every wisp of air from my lungs, and I lay there struggling to inhale, to exhale, to do anything.  That's how I feel now, trying to remember how to breathe, unable to speak, totally stunned as the name bounces around the inside of my skull. Someone is gripping my arm, a boy from the Seam, and I think maybe I started to fall and he caught me.  There must have been some mistake. This can't be happening. Prim was one slip of paper in thousands! Her chances of being chosen so remote that I'd not even bothered to worry about her. Hadn't I done everything? Taken the tesserae, refused to let her do the same? One slip. One slip in thousands. The odds had been entirely in her favor. But it hadn't mattered.  Somewhere far away, I can hear the crowd murmuring unhappily as they always do when a twelve-year-old gets chosen because no one thinks this is fair. And then I see her, the blood drained from her face, hands clenched in fists at her sides, walking with stiff, small steps up toward the stage, passing me, and I see the back of her blouse has become untucked and hangs out over her skirt. It's this detail, the untucked blouse forming a ducktail, that brings me back to myself.  ""Prim!"" The strangled cry comes out of my throat, and my muscles begin to move again. ""Prim!"" I don't need to shove through the crowd. The other kids make way immediately allowing me a straight path to the stage. I reach her just as she is about to mount the steps. With one sweep of my arm, I push her behind me.  ""I volunteer!"" I gasp. ""I volunteer as tribute!""  There's some confusion on the stage. District 12 hasn't had a volunteer in decades and the protocol has become rusty. The rule is that once a tribute's name has been pulled from the ball, another eligible boy, if a boy's name has been read, or girl, if a girl's name has been read, can step forward to take his or her place. In some districts, in which winning the reaping is such a great honor, people are eager to risk their lives, the volunteering is complicated. But in District 12, where the word tribute is pretty much synonymous with the word corpse, volunteers are all but extinct.  ""Lovely!"" says Effie Trinket. ""But I believe there's a small matter of introducing the reaping winner and then asking for volunteers, and if one does come forth then we, um. "" she trails off, unsure herself.  ""What does it matter?"" says the mayor. He's looking at me with a pained expression on his face. He doesn't know me really, but there's a faint recognition there. I am the girl who brings the strawberries. The girl his daughter might have spoken of on occasion. The girl who five years ago stood huddled with her mother and sister, as he presented her, the oldest child, with a medal of valor. A medal for her father, vaporized in the mines. Does he remember that? ""What does it matter?"" he repeats gruffly. ""Let her come forward.""  Prim is screaming hysterically behind me. She's wrapped her skinny arms around me like a vice. ""No, Katniss! No! You can't go!""  ""Prim, let go,"" I say harshly, because this is upsetting me and I don't want to cry. When they televise the replay of the reapings tonight, everyone will make note of my tears, and I'll be marked as an easy target. A weakling. I will give no one that satisfaction. ""Let go!""  I can feel someone pulling her from my back. I turn and see Gale has lifted Prim off the ground and she's thrashing in his arms. ""Up you go, Catnip,"" he says, in a voice he's fighting to keep steady, and then he carries Prim off toward my mother. I steel myself and climb the steps.  ""Well, bravo!"" gushes Effie Trinket. ""That's the spirit of the Games!"" She's pleased to finally have a district with a little action going on in it. ""What's your name?""  I swallow hard. ""Katniss Everdeen,"" I say.  ""I bet my buttons that was your sister. Don't want her to steal all the glory, do we? Come on, everybody! Let's give a big round of applause to our newest tribute!"" trills Effie Trinket.  To the everlasting credit of the people of District 12, not one person claps. Not even the ones holding betting slips, the ones who are usually beyond caring. Possibly because they know me from the Hob, or knew my father, or have encountered Prim, who no one can help loving. So instead of acknowledging applause, I stand there unmoving while they take part in the boldest form of dissent they can manage. Silence. Which says we do not agree. We do not condone. All of this is wrong.  Then something unexpected happens. At least, I don't expect it because I don't think of District 12 as a place that cares about me. But a shift has occurred since I stepped up to take Prim's place, and now it seems I have become someone precious. At first one, then another, then almost every member of the crowd touches the three middle fingers of their left hand to their lips and holds it out to me. It is an old and rarely used gesture of our district, occasionally seen at funerals. It means thanks, it means admiration, it means good-bye to someone you love.  Now I am truly in danger of crying, but fortunately Haymitch chooses this time to come staggering across the stage to congratulate me. ""Look at her. Look at this one!"" he hollers, throwing an arm around my shoulders. He's surprisingly strong for such a wreck. ""I like her!"" His breath reeks of liquor and it's been a long time since he's bathed. ""Lots of. "" He can't think of the word for a while. ""Spunk!"" he says triumphantly. ""More than you!"" he releases me and starts for the front of the stage. ""More than you!"" he shouts, pointing directly into a camera.  Is he addressing the audience or is he so drunk he might actually be taunting the Capitol? I'll never know because just as he's opening his mouth to continue, Haymitch plummets off the stage and knocks himself unconscious.  He's disgusting, but I'm grateful. With every camera gleefully trained on him, I have just enough time to release the small, choked sound in my throat and compose myself. I put my hands behind my back and stare into the distance.  I can see the hills I climbed this morning with Gale. For a moment, I yearn for something. the idea of us leaving the district. making our way in the woods. but I know I was right about not running off. Because who else would have volunteered for Prim?  Haymitch is whisked away on a stretcher, and Effie Trinket is trying to get the ball rolling again. ""What an exciting day!"" she warbles as she attempts to straighten her wig, which has listed severely to the right. ""But more excitement to come! It's time to choose our boy tribute!"" Clearly hoping to contain her tenuous hair situation, she plants one hand on her head as she crosses to the ball that contains the boys' names and grabs the first slip she encounters. She zips back to the podium, and I don't even have time to wish for Gale's safety when she's reading the name. ""Peeta Mellark.""  Peeta Mellark!  Oh, no, I think. Not him. Because I recognize this name, although I have never spoken directly to its owner. Peeta Mellark.  No, the odds are not in my favor today. I watch him as he makes his way toward the stage. Medium height, stocky build, ashy blond hair that falls in waves over his forehead. The shock of the moment is registering on his face, you can see his struggle to remain emotionless, but his blue eyes show the alarm I've seen so often in prey. Yet he climbs steadily onto the stage and takes his place.  Effie Trinket asks for volunteers, but no one steps forward. He has two older brothers, I know, I've seen them in the bakery, but one is probably too old now to volunteer and the other won't. This is standard. Family devotion only goes so far for most people on reaping day. What I did was the radical thing.  The mayor begins to read the long, dull Treaty of Treason as he does every year at this point  -  it's required  -  but I'm not listening to a word.  Why him? I think. Then I try to convince myself it doesn't matter. Peeta Mellark and I are not friends. Not even neighbors. We don't speak. Our only real interaction happened years ago. He's probably forgotten it. But I haven't and I know I never will.  It was during the worst time. My father had been killed in the mine accident three months earlier in the bitterest January anyone could remember. The numbness of his loss had passed, and the pain would hit me out of nowhere, doubling me over, racking my body with sobs. Where are you? I would cry out in my mind. Where have you gone? Of course, there was never any answer.  The district had given us a small amount of money as compensation for his death, enough to cover one month of grieving at which time my mother would be expected to get a job. Only she didn't. She didn't do anything but sit propped up in a chair or, more often, huddled under the blankets on her bed, eyes fixed on some point in the distance. Once in a while, she'd stir, get up as if moved by some urgent purpose, only to then collapse back into stillness. No amount of pleading from Prim seemed to affect her.  I was terrified. I suppose now that my mother was locked in some dark world of sadness, but at the time, all I knew was that I had lost not only a father, but a mother as well. At eleven years old, with Prim just seven, I took over as head of the family. There was no choice. I bought our food at the market and cooked it as best I could and tried to keep Prim and myself looking presentable. Because if it had become known that my mother could no longer care for us, the district would have taken us away from her and placed us in the community home. I'd grown up seeing those home kids at school. The sadness, the marks of angry hands on their faces, the hopelessness that curled their shoulders forward. I could never let that happen to Prim. Sweet, tiny Prim who cried when I cried before she even knew the reason, who brushed and plaited my mother's hair before we left for school, who still polished my father's shaving mirror each night because he'd hated the layer of coal dust that settled on everything in the Seam. The community home would crush her like a bug. So I kept our predicament a secret.  But the money ran out and we were slowly starving to death. There's no other way to put it. I kept telling myself if I could only hold out until May, just May 8th, I would turn twelve and be able to sign up for the tesserae and get that precious grain and oil to feed us. Only there were still several weeks to go. We could well be dead by then.  Starvation's not an uncommon fate in District 12. Who hasn't seen the victims? Older people who can't work. Children from a family with too many to feed. Those injured in the mines. Straggling through the streets. And one day, you come upon them sitting motionless against a wall or lying in the Meadow, you hear the wails from a house, and the Peacekeepers are called in to retrieve the body. Starvation is never the cause of death officially. It's always the flu, or exposure, or pneumonia. But that fools no one.  On the afternoon of my encounter with Peeta Mellark, the rain was falling in relentless icy sheets. I had been in town, trying to trade some threadbare old baby clothes of Prim's in the public market, but there were no takers. Although I had been to the Hob on several occasions with my father, I was too frightened to venture into that rough, gritty place alone. The rain had soaked through my father's hunting jacket, leaving me chilled to the bone. For three days, we'd had nothing but boiled water with some old dried mint leaves I'd found in the back of a cupboard. By the time the market closed, I was shaking so hard I dropped my bundle of baby clothes in a mud puddle. I didn't pick it up for fear I would keel over and be unable to regain my feet. Besides, no one wanted those clothes.  I couldn't go home. Because at home was my mother with her dead eyes and my little sister, with her hollow cheeks and cracked lips. I couldn't walk into that room with the smoky fire from the damp branches I had scavenged at the edge of the woods after the coal had run out, my bands empty of any hope.  I found myself stumbling along a muddy lane behind the shops that serve the wealthiest townspeople. The merchants live above their businesses, so I was essentially in their backyards. I remember the outlines of garden beds not yet planted for the spring, a goat or two in a pen, one sodden dog tied to a post, hunched defeated in the muck.  All forms of stealing are forbidden in District 12. Punishable by death. But it crossed my mind that there might be something in the trash bins, and those were fair game. Perhaps a bone at the butcher's or rotted vegetables at the grocer's, something no one but my family was desperate enough to eat. Unfortunately, the bins had just been emptied.  When I passed the baker's, the smell of fresh bread was so overwhelming I felt dizzy. The ovens were in the back, and a golden glow spilled out the open kitchen door. I stood mesmerized by the heat and the luscious scent until the rain interfered, running its icy fingers down my back, forcing me back to life. I lifted the lid to the baker's trash bin and found it spotlessly, heartlessly bare.  Suddenly a voice was screaming at me and I looked up to see the baker's wife, telling me to move on and did I want her to call the Peacekeepers and how sick she was of having those brats from the Seam pawing through her trash. The words were ugly and I had no defense. As I carefully replaced the lid and backed away, I noticed him, a boy with blond hair peering out from behind his mother's back. I'd seen him at school. He was in my year, but I didn't know his name. He stuck with the town kids, so how would I? His mother went back into the bakery, grumbling, but he must have been watching me as I made my way behind the pen that held their pig and leaned against the far side of an old apple tree. The realization that I'd have nothing to take home had finally sunk in. My knees buckled and I slid down the tree trunk to its roots. It was too much. I was too sick and weak and tired, oh, so tired. Let them call the Peacekeepers and take us to the community home, I thought. Or better yet, let me die right here in the rain.  There was a clatter in the bakery and I heard the woman screaming again and the sound of a blow, and I vaguely wondered what was going on. Feet sloshed toward me through the mud and I thought, It's her. She's coming to drive me away with a stick. But it wasn't her. It was the boy. In his arms, he carried two large loaves of bread that must have fallen into the fire because the crusts were scorched black.  His mother was yelling, ""Feed it to the pig, you stupid creature! Why not? No one decent will buy burned bread!""  He began to tear off chunks from the burned parts and toss them into the trough, and the front bakery bell rung and the mother disappeared to help a customer.  The boy never even glanced my way, but I was watching him. Because of the bread, because of the red weal that stood out on his cheekbone. What had she hit him with?  My parents never hit us. I couldn't even imagine it. The boy took one look back to the bakery as if checking that the coast was clear, then, his attention back on the pig, he threw a loaf of bread in my direction. The second quickly followed, and he sloshed back to the bakery, closing the kitchen door tightly behind him.  I stared at the loaves in disbelief. They were fine, perfect really, except for the burned areas. Did he mean for me to have them? He must have. Because there they were at my feet. Before anyone could witness what had happened I shoved the loaves up under my shirt, wrapped the hunting jacket tightly about me, and walked swiftly away. The heat of the bread burned into my skin, but I clutched it tighter, clinging to life.  By the time I reached home, the loaves had cooled somewhat, but the insides were still warm. When I dropped them on the table, Prim's hands reached to tear off a chunk, but I made her sit, forced my mother to join us at the table, and poured warm tea. I scraped off the black stuff and sliced the bread. We ate an entire loaf, slice by slice. It was good hearty bread, filled with raisins and nuts.  I put my clothes to dry at the fire, crawled into bed, and fell into a dreamless sleep. It didn't occur to me until the next morning that the boy might have burned the bread on purpose. Might have dropped the loaves into the flames, knowing it meant being punished, and then delivered them to me. But I dismissed this. It must have been an accident. Why would he have done it? He didn't even know me. Still, just throwing me the bread was an enormous kindness that would have surely resulted in a beating if discovered. I couldn't explain his actions.  We ate slices of bread for breakfast and headed to school. It was as if spring had come overnight. Warm sweet air. Fluffy clouds. At school, I passed the boy in the hall, his cheek had swelled up and his eye had blackened. He was with his friends and didn't acknowledge me in any way. But as I collected Prim and started for home that afternoon, I found him staring at me from across the school yard. Our eyes met for only a second, then he turned his head away. I dropped my gaze, embarrassed, and that's when I saw it. The first dandelion of the year. A bell went off in my head. I thought of the hours spent in the woods with my father and I knew how we were going to survive.  To this day, I can never shake the connection between this boy, Peeta Mellark, and the bread that gave me hope, and the dandelion that reminded me that I was not doomed. And more than once, I have turned in the school hallway and caught his eyes trained on me, only to quickly flit away. I feel like I owe him something, and I hate owing people. Maybe if I had thanked him at some point, I'd be feeling less conflicted now. I thought about it a couple of times, but the opportunity never seemed to present itself. And now it never will. Because we're going to be thrown into an arena to fight to the death. Exactly how am I supposed to work in a thank-you in there? Somehow it just won't seem sincere if I'm trying to slit his throat.  The mayor finishes the dreary Treaty of Treason and motions for Peeta and me to shake hands. His are as solid and warm as those loaves of bread. Peeta looks me right in the eye and gives my hand what I think is meant to be a reassuring squeeze. Maybe it's just a nervous spasm.  We turn back to face the crowd as the anthem of Panem plays.  Oh, well, I think. There will be twenty-four of us. Odds are someone else will kill him before I do.  Of course, the odds have not been very dependable of late."
Hunger Games Chapter 3,"The moment the anthem ends, we are taken into custody. I don't mean we're handcuffed or anything, but a group of Peacekeepers marches us through the front door of the Justice Building. Maybe tributes have tried to escape in the past. I've never seen that happen though.  Once inside, I'm conducted to a room and left alone. It's the richest place I've ever been in, with thick, deep carpets and a velvet couch and chairs. I know velvet because my mother has a dress with a collar made of the stuff. When I sit on the couch, I can't help running my fingers over the fabric repeatedly. It helps to calm me as I try to prepare for the next hour. The time allotted for the tributes to say goodbye to their loved ones. I cannot afford to get upset, to leave this room with puffy eyes and a red nose. Crying is not an option. There will be more cameras at the train station.  My sister and my mother come first. I reach out to Prim and she climbs on my lap, her arms around my neck, head on my shoulder, just like she did when she was a toddler. My mother sits beside me and wraps her arms around us. For a few minutes, we say nothing. Then I start telling them all the things they must remember to do, now that I will not be there to do them for them.  Prim is not to take any tesserae. They can get by, if they're careful, on selling Prim's goat milk and cheese and the small apothecary business my mother now runs for the people in the Seam. Gale will get her the herbs she doesn't grow herself, but she must be very careful to describe them because he's not as familiar with them as I am. He'll also bring them game  -  he and I made a pact about this a year or so ago  -  and will probably not ask for compensation, but they should thank him with some kind of trade, like milk or medicine.  I don't bother suggesting Prim learn to hunt. I tried to teach her a couple of times and it was disastrous. The woods terrified her, and whenever I shot something, she'd get teary and talk about how we might be able to heal it if we got it home soon enough. But she makes out well with her goat, so I concentrate on that.  When I am done with instructions about fuel, and trading, and staying in school, I turn to my mother and grip her arm, hard. ""Listen to me. Are you listening to me?"" She nods, alarmed by my intensity. She must know what's coming. ""You can't leave again,"" I say.  My mother's eyes find the floor. ""I know. I won't. I couldn't help what - ""  ""Well, you have to help it this time. You can't clock out and leave Prim on her own. There's no me now to keep you both alive. It doesn't matter what happens. Whatever you see on the screen. You have to promise me you'll fight through it!"" My voice has risen to a shout. In it is all the anger, all the fear I felt at her abandonment.  She pulls her arm from my grasp, moved to anger herself now. ""I was ill. I could have treated myself if I'd had the medicine I have now.""  That part about her being ill might be true. I've seen her bring back people suffering from immobilizing sadness since. Perhaps it is a sickness, but it's one we can't afford.  ""Then take it. And take care of her!"" I say.  ""I'll be all right, Katniss,"" says Prim, clasping my face in her hands. ""But you have to take care, too. You're so fast and brave. Maybe you can win.""  I can't win. Prim must know that in her heart. The competition will be far beyond my abilities. Kids from wealthier districts, where winning is a huge honor, who've been trained their whole lives for this. Boys who are two to three times my size. Girls who know twenty different ways to kill you with a knife. Oh, there'll be people like me, too. People to weed out before the real fun begins.  ""Maybe,"" I say, because I can hardly tell my mother to carry on if I've already given up myself. Besides, it isn't in my nature to go down without a fight, even when things seem insurmountable. ""Then we'd be rich as Haymitch.""  ""I don't care if we're rich. I just want you to come home. You will try, won't you? Really, really try?"" asks Prim.  ""Really, really try. I swear it,"" I say. And I know, because of Prim, I'll have to.  And then the Peacekeeper is at the door, signaling our time is up, and we're all hugging one another so hard it hurts and all I'm saying is ""I love you. I love you both."" And they're saying it back and then the Peacekeeper orders them out and the door closes. I bury my head in one of the velvet pillows as if this can block the whole thing out.  Someone else enters the room, and when I look up, I'm surprised to see it's the baker, Peeta Mellark's father. I can't believe he's come to visit me. After all, I'll be trying to kill his son soon. But we do know each other a bit, and he knows Prim even better. When she sells her goat cheeses at the Hob, she puts two of them aside for him and he gives her a generous amount of bread in return. We always wait to trade with him when his witch of a wife isn't around because he's so much nicer. I feel certain he would never have hit his son the way she did over the burned bread. But why has he come to see me?  The baker sits awkwardly on the edge of one of the plush chairs. He's a big, broad-shouldered man with burn scars from years at the ovens. He must have just said goodbye to his son.  He pulls a white paper package from his jacket pocket and holds it out to me. I open it and find cookies. These are a luxury we can never afford.  ""Thank you,"" I say. The baker's not a very talkative man in the best of times, and today he has no words at all. ""I had some of your bread this morning. My friend Gale gave you a squirrel for it."" He nods, as if remembering the squirrel. ""Not your best trade,"" I say. He shrugs as if it couldn't possibly matter.  Then I can't think of anything else, so we sit in silence until a Peacemaker summons him. He rises and coughs to clear his throat. ""I'll keep an eye on the little girl. Make sure she's eating.""  I feel some of the pressure in my chest lighten at his words. People deal with me, but they are genuinely fond of Prim. Maybe there will be enough fondness to keep her alive.  My next guest is also unexpected. Madge walks straight to me. She is not weepy or evasive, instead there's an urgency about her tone that surprises me. ""They let you wear one thing from your district in the arena. One thing to remind you of home. Will you wear this?"" She holds out the circular gold pin that was on her dress earlier. I hadn't paid much attention to it before, but now I see it's a small bird in flight.  ""Your pin?"" I say. Wearing a token from my district is about the last thing on my mind.  ""Here, I'll put it on your dress, all right?"" Madge doesn't wait for an answer, she just leans in and fixes the bird to my dress. ""Promise you'll wear it into the arena, Katniss?"" she asks. ""Promise?""  ""Yes,"" I say. Cookies. A pin. I'm getting all kinds of gifts today. Madge gives me one more. A kiss on the cheek. Then she's gone and I'm left thinking that maybe Madge really has been my friend all along.  Finally, Gale is here and maybe there is nothing romantic between us, but when he opens his arms I don't hesitate to go into them. His body is familiar to me  -  the way it moves, the smell of wood smoke, even the sound of his heart beating I know from quiet moments on a hunt  -  but this is the first time I really feel it, lean and hard-muscled against my own.  ""Listen,"" he says. ""Getting a knife should be pretty easy, but you've got to get your hands on a bow. That's your best chance.""  ""They don't always have bows,"" I say, thinking of the year there were only horrible spiked maces that the tributes had to bludgeon one another to death with.  ""Then make one,"" says Gale. ""Even a weak bow is better than no bow at all.""  I have tried copying my father's bows with poor results. It's not that easy. Even he had to scrap his own work sometimes.  ""I don't even know if there'll be wood,"" I say. Another year, they tossed everybody into a landscape of nothing but boulders and sand and scruffy bushes. I particularly hated that year. Many contestants were bitten by venomous snakes or went insane from thirst.  ""There's almost always some wood,"" Gale says. ""Since that year half of them died of cold. Not much entertainment in that.""  It's true. We spent one Hunger Games watching the players freeze to death at night. You could hardly see them because they were just huddled in balls and had no wood for fires or torches or anything. It was considered very anti-climactic in the Capitol, all those quiet, bloodless deaths. Since then, there's usually been wood to make fires.  ""Yes, there's usually some,"" I say.  ""Katniss, it's just hunting. You're the best hunter I know,"" says Gale.  ""It's not just hunting. They're armed. They think,"" I say.  ""So do you. And you've had more practice. Real practice,"" he says. ""You know how to kill.""  ""Not people,"" I say.  ""How different can it be, really?"" says Gale grimly.  The awful thing is that if I can forget they're people, it will be no different at all.  The Peacekeepers are back too soon and Gale asks for more time, but they're taking him away and I start to panic. ""Don't let them starve!"" I cry out, clinging to his hand.  ""I won't! You know I won't! Katniss, remember I  - "" he says, and they yank us apart and slam the door and I'll never know what it was he wanted me to remember.  It's a short ride from the Justice Building to the train station. I've never been in a car before. Rarely even ridden in wagons. In the Seam, we travel on foot.  I've been right not to cry. The station is swarming with reporters with their insectlike cameras trained directly on my face. But I've had a lot of practice at wiping my face clean of emotions and I do this now. I catch a glimpse of myself on the television screen on the wall that's airing my arrival live and feel gratified that I appear almost bored.  Peeta Mellark, on the other hand, has obviously been crying and interestingly enough does not seem to be trying to cover it up. I immediately wonder if this will be his strategy in the Games. To appear weak and frightened, to reassure the other tributes that he is no competition at all, and then come out fighting. This worked very well for a girl, Johanna Mason, from District 7 a few years back. She seemed like such a sniveling, cowardly fool that no one bothered about her until there were only a handful of contestants left. It turned out she could kill viciously. Pretty clever, the way she played it. But this seems an odd strategy for Peeta Mellark because he's a baker's son. All those years of having enough to eat and hauling bread trays around have made him broad-shouldered and strong. It will take an awful lot of weeping to convince anyone to overlook him.  We have to stand for a few minutes in the doorway of the train while the cameras gobble up our images, then we're allowed inside and the doors close mercifully behind us. The train begins to move at once.  The speed initially takes my breath away. Of course, I've never been on a train, as travel between the districts is forbidden except for officially sanctioned duties. For us, that's mainly transporting coal. But this is no ordinary coal train. It's one of the high-speed Capitol models that average 250 miles per hour. Our journey to the Capitol will take less than a day.  In school, they tell us the Capitol was built in a place once called the Rockies. District 12 was in a region known is Appalachia. Even hundreds of years ago, they mined coal here. Which is why our miners have to dig so deep.  Somehow it all comes back to coal at school. Besides basic reading and math most of our instruction is coal-related. Except for the weekly lecture on the history of Panem. It's mostly a lot of blather about what we owe the Capitol. I know there must be more than they're telling us, an actual account of what happened during the rebellion. But I don't spend much time thinking about it. Whatever the truth is, I don't see how it will help me get food on the table.  The tribute train is fancier than even the room in the Justice Building. We are each given our own chambers that have a bedroom, a dressing area, and a private bathroom with hot and cold running water. We don't have hot water at home, unless we boil it.  There are drawers filled with fine clothes, and Effie Trinket tells me to do anything I want, wear anything I want, everything is at my disposal. Just be ready for supper in an hour. I peel off my mother's blue dress and take a hot shower. I've never had a shower before. It's like being in a summer rain, only warmer. I dress in a dark green shirt and pants.  At the last minute, I remember Madge's little gold pin. For the first time, I get a good look at it. It's as if someone fashioned a small golden bird and then attached a ring around it. The bird is connected to the ring only by its wing tips. I suddenly recognize it. A mocking jay.  They're funny birds and something of a slap in the face to the Capitol. During the rebellion, the Capitol bred a series of genetically altered animals as weapons. The common term for them was muttations, or sometimes mutts for short. One was a special bird called a jabber jay that had the ability to memorize and repeat whole human conversations. They were homing birds, exclusively male, that were released into regions where the Capitol's enemies were known to be hiding. After the birds gathered words, they'd fly back to centers to be recorded. It took people awhile to realize what was going on in the districts, how private conversations were being transmitted. Then, of course, the rebels fed the Capitol endless lies, and the joke was on it. So the centers were shut down and the birds were abandoned to die off in the wild.  Only they didn't die off. Instead, the jabber jays mated with female mockingbirds creating a whole new species that could replicate both bird whistles and human melodies. They had lost the ability to enunciate words but could still mimic a range of human vocal sounds, from a child's high-pitched warble to a man's deep tones. And they could re-create songs. Not just a few notes, but whole songs with multiple verses, if you had the patience to sing them and if they liked your voice.  My father was particularly fond of mockingjays. When we went hunting, he would whistle or sing complicated songs to them and, after a polite pause, they'd always sing back. Not everyone is treated with such respect. But whenever my father sang, all the birds in the area would fall silent and listen. His voice was that beautiful, high and clear and so filled with life it made you want to laugh and cry at the same time. I could never bring myself to continue the practice after he was gone. Still, there's something comforting about the little bird. It's like having a piece of my father with me, protecting me. I fasten the pin onto my shirt, and with the dark green fabric as a background, I can almost imagine the mockingjay flying through the trees.  Effie Trinket comes to collect me for supper. I follow her through the narrow, rocking corridor into a dining room with polished paneled walls. There's a table where all the dishes are highly breakable. Peeta Mellark sits waiting for us, the chair next to him empty.  ""Where's Haymitch?"" asks Effie Trinket brightly.  ""Last time I saw him, he said he was going to take a nap,"" says Peeta.  ""Well, it's been an exhausting day,"" says Effie Trinket. I think she's relieved by Haymitch's absence, and who can blame her?  The supper comes in courses. A thick carrot soup, green salad, lamb chops and mashed potatoes, cheese and fruit, a chocolate cake. Throughout the meal, Effie Trinket keeps reminding us to save space because there's more to come. But I'm stuffing myself because I've never had food like this, so good and so much, and because probably the best thing I can do between now and the Games is put on a few pounds.  ""At least, you two have decent manners,"" says Effie as we're finishing the main course. ""The pair last year ate everything with their hands like a couple of savages. It completely upset my digestion.""  The pair last year were two kids from the Seam who'd never, not one day of their lives, had enough to eat. And when they did have food, table manners were surely the last thing on their minds. Peeta's a baker's son. My mother taught Prim and I to eat properly, so yes, I can handle a fork and knife. But I hate Effie Trinket's comment so much I make a point of eating the rest of my meal with my fingers. Then I wipe my hands on the tablecloth. This makes her purse her lips tightly together.  Now that the meal's over, I'm fighting to keep the food down. I can see Peeta's looking a little green, too. Neither of our stomachs is used to such rich fare. But if I can hold down Greasy Sae's concoction of mice meat, pig entrails, and tree bark  -  a winter specialty  -  I'm determined to hang on to this.  We go to another compartment to watch the recap of the reapings across Panem. They try to stagger them throughout the day so a person could conceivably watch the whole thing live, but only people in the Capitol could really do that, since none of them have to attend reapings themselves.  One by one, we see the other reapings, the names called, (the volunteers stepping forward or, more often, not. We examine the faces of the kids who will be our competition. A few stand out in my mind. A monstrous boy who lunges forward to volunteer from District 2. A fox-faced girl with sleek red hair from District 5. A boy with a crippled foot from District 10. And most hauntingly, a twelve-year-old girl from District 11. She has dark brown skin and eyes, but other than that, she's very like Prim in size and demeanor. Only when she mounts the stage and they ask for volunteers, all you can hear is the wind whistling through the decrepit buildings around her. There's no one willing to take her place.  Last of all, they show District 12. Prim being called, me running forward to volunteer. You can't miss the desperation in my voice as I shove Prim behind me, as if I'm afraid no one will hear and they'll take Prim away. But, of course, they do hear. I see Gale pulling her off me and watch myself mount the stage. The commentators are not sure what to say about the crowd's refusal to applaud. The silent salute. One says that District 12 has always been a bit backward but that local customs can be charming. As if on cue, Haymitch falls off the stage, and they groan comically. Peeta's name is drawn, and he quietly takes his place. We shake hands. They cut to the anthem again, and the pro-gram ends.  Effie Trinket is disgruntled about the state her wig was in. ""Your mentor has a lot to learn about presentation. A lot about televised behavior.""  Peeta unexpectedly laughs. ""He was drunk,"" says Peeta. ""He's drunk every year.""  ""Every day,"" I add. I can't help smirking a little. Effie Trinket makes it sound like Haymitch just has somewhat rough manners that could be corrected with a few tips from her.  ""Yes,"" hisses Effie Trinket. ""How odd you two find it amusing. You know your mentor is your lifeline to the world in these Games. The one who advises you, lines up your sponsors, and dictates the presentation of any gifts. Haymitch can well be the difference between your life and your death!""  Just then, Haymitch staggers into the compartment. ""I miss supper?"" he says in a slurred voice. Then he vomits all over the expensive carpet and falls in the mess.  ""So laugh away!"" says Effie Trinket. She hops in her pointy shoes around the pool of vomit and flees the room."
Hunger Games Chapter 4,"For a few moments, Peeta and I take in the scene of our mentor trying to rise out of the slippery vile stuff from his stomach. The reek of vomit and raw spirits almost brings my dinner up. We exchange a glance. Obviously Haymitch isn't much, but Effie Trinket is right about one thing, once we're in the arena he's all we've got. As if by some unspoken agreement, Peeta and I each take one of Haymitch's arms and help him to his feet.  ""I tripped?"" Haymitch asks. ""Smells bad."" He wipes his hand on his nose, smearing his face with vomit.  ""Let's get you back to your room,"" says Peeta. ""Clean you up a bit.""  We half-lead half-carry Haymitch back to his compartment. Since we can't exactly set him down on the embroidered bedspread, we haul him into the bathtub and turn the shower on him. He hardly notices.  ""It's okay,"" Peeta says to me. ""I'll take it from here.""  I can't help feeling a little grateful since the last thing I want to do is strip down Haymitch, wash the vomit out of his chest hair, and tuck him into bed. Possibly Peeta is trying to make a good impression on him, to be his favorite once the Games begin. But judging by the state he's in, Haymitch will have no memory of this tomorrow.  ""All right,"" I say. ""I can send one of the Capitol people to help you."" There's any number on the train. Cooking for us. Waiting on us. Guarding us. Taking care of us is their job.  ""No. I don't want them,"" says Peeta.  I nod and head to my own room. I understand how Peeta feels. I can't stand the sight of the Capitol people myself. But making them deal with Haymitch might be a small form of revenge. So I'm pondering the reason why he insists on taking care of Haymitch and all of a sudden I think, It's because he's being kind. Just as he was kind to give me the bread.  The idea pulls me up short. A kind Peeta Mellark is far more dangerous to me than an unkind one. Kind people have a way of working their way inside me and rooting there. And I can't let Peeta do this. Not where we're going. So I decide, from this moment on, to have as little as possible to do with the baker's son.  When I get back to my room, the train is pausing at a platform to refuel. I quickly open the window, toss the cookies Peeta's father gave me out of the train, and slam the glass shut. No more. No more of either of them.  Unfortunately, the packet of cookies hits the ground and bursts open in a patch of dandelions by the track. I only see the image for a moment, because the train is off again, but it's enough. Enough to remind me of that other dandelion in the school yard years ago.  I had just turned away from Peeta Mellark's bruised face when I saw the dandelion and I knew hope wasn't lost. I plucked it carefully and hurried home. I grabbed a bucket and Prim's hand and headed to the Meadow and yes, it was dotted with the golden-headed weeds. After we'd harvested those, we scrounged along inside the fence for probably a mile until we'd filled the bucket with the dandelion greens, stems, and flowers. That night, we gorged ourselves on dandelion salad and the rest of the bakery bread.  ""What else?"" Prim asked me. ""What other food can we find?""  ""All kinds of things,"" I promised her. ""I just have to remember them.""  My mother had a book she'd brought with her from the apothecary shop. The pages were made of old parchment and covered in ink drawings of plants. Neat handwritten blocks told their names, where to gather them, when they came in bloom, their medical uses. But my father added other entries to the book. Plants for eating, not healing. Dandelions, pokeweed, wild onions, pines. Prim and I spent the rest of the night poring over those pages.  The next day, we were off school. For a while I hung around the edges of the Meadow, but finally I worked up the courage to go under the fence. It was the first time I'd been there alone, without my father's weapons to protect me. But I retrieved the small bow and arrows he'd made me from a hollow tree. I probably didn't go more than twenty yards into the woods that day. Most of the time, I perched up in the branches of an old oak, hoping for game to come by. After several hours, I had the good luck to kill a rabbit.  I'd shot a few rabbits before, with my father's guidance. But this I'd done on my own.  We hadn't had meat in months. The sight of the rabbit seemed to stir something in my mother. She roused herself, skinned the carcass, and made a stew with the meat and some more greens Prim had gathered. Then she acted confused and went back to bed, but when the stew was done, we made her eat a bowl.  The woods became our savior, and each day I went a bit farther into its arms. It was slow-going at first, but I was determined to feed us. I stole eggs from nests, caught fish in nets, sometimes managed to shoot a squirrel or rabbit for stew, and gathered the various plants that sprung up beneath my feet. Plants are tricky. Many are edible, but one false mouthful and you're dead. I checked and double-checked the plants I harvested with my father's pictures. I kept us alive.  Any sign of danger, a distant howl, the inexplicable break of a branch, sent me flying back to the fence at first. Then I began to risk climbing trees to escape the wild dogs that quickly got bored and moved on. Bears and cats lived deeper in, perhaps disliking the sooty reek of our district.  On May 8th, I went to the Justice Building, signed up for my tesserae, and pulled home my first batch of grain and oil in Prim's toy wagon. On the eighth of every month, I was entitled to do the same. I couldn't stop hunting and gathering, of course. The grain was not enough to live on, and there were other things to buy, soap and milk and thread. What we didn't absolutely have to eat, I began to trade at the Hob. It was frightening to enter that place without my father at my side, but people had respected him, and they accepted me. Game was game after all, no matter who'd shot it. I also sold at the back doors of the wealthier clients in town, trying to remember what my father had told me and learning a few new tricks as well. The butcher would buy my rabbits but not squirrels. The baker enjoyed squirrel but would only trade for one if his wife wasn't around. The Head Peacekeeper loved wild turkey. The mayor had a passion for strawberries.  In late summer, I was washing up in a pond when I noticed the plants growing around me. Tall with leaves like arrowheads. Blossoms with three white petals. I knelt down in the water, my fingers digging into the soft mud, and I pulled up handfuls of the roots. Small, bluish tubers that don't look like much but boiled or baked are as good as any potato. ""Katniss,"" I said aloud. It's the plant I was named for. And I heard my father's voice joking, ""As long as you can find yourself, you'll never starve."" I spent hours stirring up the pond bed with my toes and a stick, gathering the tubers that floated to the top. That night, we feasted on fish and katniss roots until we were all, for the first time in months, full.  Slowly, my mother returned to us. She began to clean and cook and preserve some of the food I brought in for winter. People traded us or paid money for her medical remedies. One day, I heard her singing.  Prim was thrilled to have her back, but I kept watching, waiting for her to disappear on us again. I didn't trust her. And some small gnarled place inside me hated her for her weakness, for her neglect, for the months she had put us through. Prim forgave her, but I had taken a step back from my mother, put up a wall to protect myself from needing her, and nothing was ever the same between us again.  Now I was going to die without that ever being set right. I thought of how I had yelled at her today in the Justice Building. I had told her I loved her, too, though. So maybe it would all balance out.  For a while I stand staring out the train window, wishing I could open it again, but unsure of what would happen at such high speed. In the distance, I see the lights of another district. 7? 10? I don't know. I think about the people in their houses, settling in for bed. I imagine my home, with its shutters drawn tight. What are they doing now, my mother and Prim? Were they able to eat supper? The fish stew and the strawberries? Or did it lay untouched on their plates? Did they watch the recap of the day's events on the battered old TV that sits on the table against the wall? Surely, there were more tears. Is my mother holding up, being strong for Prim? Or has she already started to slip away, leaving the weight of the world on my sister's fragile shoulders?  Prim will undoubtedly sleep with my mother tonight. The thought of that scruffy old Buttercup posting himself on the bed to watch over Prim comforts me. If she cries, he will nose his way into her arms and curl up there until she calms down and falls asleep. I'm so glad I didn't drown him.  Imagining my home makes me ache with loneliness. This day has been endless. Could Gale and I have been eating blackberries only this morning? It seems like a lifetime ago. Like a long dream that deteriorated into a nightmare. Maybe, if I go to sleep, I will wake up back in District 12, where I belong.  Probably the drawers hold any number of nightgowns, but I just strip off my shirt and pants and climb into bed in my underwear. The sheets are made of soft, silky fabric. A thick fluffy comforter gives immediate warmth.  If I'm going to cry, now is the time to do it. By morning, I'll be able to wash the damage done by the tears from my face. But no tears come. I'm too tired or too numb to cry. The only thing I feel is a desire to be somewhere else. So I let the train rock me into oblivion.  Gray light is leaking through the curtains when the rapping rouses me. I hear Effie Trinket's voice, calling me to rise. ""Up, up, up! It's going to be a big, big, big day!"" I try and imagine, for a moment, what it must be like inside that woman's head. What thoughts fill her waking hours? What dreams come to her at night? I have no idea.  I put the green outfit back on since it's not really dirty, just slightly crumpled from spending the night on the floor. My fingers trace the circle around the little gold mockingjay and I think of the woods, and of my father, and of my mother and Prim waking up, having to get on with things.  I slept in the elaborate braided hair my mother did for the reaping and it doesn't look too bad, so I just leave it up. It doesn't matter. We can't be far from the Capitol now. And once we reach the city, my stylist will dictate my look for the opening ceremonies tonight anyway. I just hope I get one who doesn't think nudity is the last word in fashion.  As I enter the dining car, Effie Trinket brushes by me with a cup of black coffee. She's muttering obscenities under her breath. Haymitch, his face puffy and red from the previous day's indulgences, is chuckling. Peeta holds a roll and looks somewhat embarrassed.  ""Sit down! Sit down!"" says Haymitch, waving me over. The moment I slide into my chair I'm served an enormous platter of food. Eggs, ham, piles of fried potatoes. A tureen of fruit sits in ice to keep it chilled. The basket of rolls they set before me would keep my family going for a week. There's an elegant glass of orange juice. At least, I think it's orange juice. I've only even tasted an orange once, at New Year's when my father bought one as a special treat. A cup of coffee. My mother adores coffee, which we could almost never afford, but it only tastes bitter and thin to me. A rich brown cup of something I've never seen.  ""They call it hot chocolate,"" says Peeta. ""It's good.""  I take a sip of the hot, sweet, creamy liquid and a shudder runs through me. Even though the rest of the meal beckons, I ignore it until I've drained my cup. Then I stuff down every mouthful I can hold, which is a substantial amount, being careful to not overdo it on the richest stuff. One time, my mother told me that I always eat like I'll never see food again. And I said, ""I won't unless I bring it home."" That shut her up.  When my stomach feels like it's about to split open, I lean back and take in my breakfast companions. Peeta is still eating, breaking off bits of roll and dipping them in hot chocolate. Haymitch hasn't paid much attention to his platter, but he's knocking back a glass of red juice that he keeps thinning with a clear liquid from a bottle. Judging by the fumes, it's some kind of spirit. I don't know Haymitch, but I've seen him often enough in the Hob, tossing handfuls of money on the counter of the woman who sells white liquor. He'll be incoherent by the time we reach the Capitol.  I realize I detest Haymitch. No wonder the District 12 tributes never stand a chance. It isn't just that we've been underfed and lack training. Some of our tributes have still been strong enough to make a go of it. But we rarely get sponsors and he's a big part of the reason why. The rich people who back tributes  -  either because they're betting on them or simply for the bragging rights of picking a winner  -  expect someone classier than Haymitch to deal with.  ""So, you're supposed to give us advice,"" I say to Haymitch.  ""Here's some advice. Stay alive,"" says Haymitch, and then bursts out laughing. I exchange a look with Peeta before I remember I'm having nothing more to do with him. I'm surprised to see the hardness in his eyes. He generally seems so mild.  ""That's very funny,"" says Peeta. Suddenly he lashes out at the glass in Haymitch's hand. It shatters on the floor, sending the bloodred liquid running toward the back of the train. ""Only not to us.""  Haymitch considers this a moment, then punches Peeta in the jaw, knocking him from his chair. When he turns back to reach for the spirits, I drive my knife into the table between his hand and the bottle, barely missing his fingers. I brace myself to deflect his hit, but it doesn't come. Instead he sits back and squints at us.  ""Well, what's this?"" says Haymitch. ""Did I actually get a pair of fighters this year?""  Peeta rises from the floor and scoops up a handful of ice from under the fruit tureen. He starts to raise it to the red mark on his jaw.  ""No,"" says Haymitch, stopping him. ""Let the bruise show. The audience will think you've mixed it up with another tribute before you've even made it to the arena.""  ""That's against the rules,"" says Peeta.  ""Only if they catch you. That bruise will say you fought, you weren't caught, even better,"" says Haymitch. He turns to me. ""Can you hit anything with that knife besides a table?""  The bow and arrow is my weapon. But I've spent a fair amount of time throwing knives as well. Sometimes, if I've wounded an animal with an arrow, it's better to get a knife into it, too, before I approach it. I realize that if I want Haymitch's attention, this is my moment to make an impression. I yank the knife out of the table, get a grip on the blade, and then throw it into the wall across the room. I was actually just hoping to get a good solid stick, but it lodges in the seam between two panels, making me look a lot better than I am.  ""Stand over here. Both of you,"" says Haymitch, nodding to the middle of the room. We obey and he circles us, prodding us like animals at times, checking our muscles, examining our faces. ""Well, you're not entirely hopeless. Seem fit. And once the stylists get hold of you, you'll be attractive enough.""  Peeta and I don't question this. The Hunger Games aren't a beauty contest, but the best-looking tributes always seem to pull more sponsors.  ""All right, I'll make a deal with you. You don't interfere with my drinking, and I'll stay sober enough to help you,"" says Haymitch. ""But you have to do exactly what I say.""  It's not much of a deal but still a giant step forward from ten minutes ago when we had no guide at all.  ""Fine,"" says Peeta.  ""So help us,"" I say. ""When we get to the arena, what's the best strategy at the Cornucopia for someone  - ""  ""One thing at a time. In a few minutes, we'll be pulling into the station. You'll be put in the hands of your stylists. You're not going to like what they do to you. But no matter what it is, don't resist,"" says Haymitch.  ""But  - "" I begin.  ""No buts. Don't resist,"" says Haymitch. He takes the bottle of spirits from the table and leaves the car. As the door swings shut behind him, the car goes dark. There are still a few lights inside, but outside it's as if night has fallen again. I realize we must be in the tunnel that runs up through the mountains into the Capitol. The mountains form a natural barrier between the Capitol and the eastern districts. It is almost impossible to enter from the east except through the tunnels. This geographical advantage was a major factor in the districts losing the war that led to my being a tribute today. Since the rebels had to scale the mountains, they were easy targets for the Capitol's air forces.  Peeta Mellark and I stand in silence as the train speeds along. The tunnel goes on and on and I think of the tons of rock separating me from the sky, and my chest tightens. I hate being encased in stone this way. It reminds me of the mines and my father, trapped, unable to reach sunlight, buried forever in the darkness.  The train finally begins to slow and suddenly bright light floods the compartment. We can't help it. Both Peeta and I run to the window to see what we've only seen on television, the Capitol, the ruling city of Panem. The cameras haven't lied about its grandeur. If anything, they have not quite captured the magnificence of the glistening buildings in a rainbow of hues that tower into the air, the shiny cars that roll down the wide paved streets, the oddly dressed people with bizarre hair and painted faces who have never missed a meal. All the colors seem artificial, the pinks too deep, the greens too bright, the yellows painful to the eyes, like the flat round disks of hard candy we can never afford to buy at the tiny sweet shop in District 12.  The people begin to point at us eagerly as they recognize a tribute train rolling into the city. I step away from the window, sickened by their excitement, knowing they can't wait to watch us die. But Peeta holds his ground, actually waving and smiling at the gawking crowd. He only stops when the train pulls into the station, blocking us from their view.  He sees me staring at him and shrugs. ""Who knows?"" he says. ""One of them may be rich.""  I have misjudged him. I think of his actions since the reaping began. The friendly squeeze of my hand. His father showing up with the cookies and promising to feed Prim. did Peeta put him up to that? His tears at the station. Volunteering to wash Haymitch but then challenging him this morning when apparently the nice-guy approach had failed. And now the waving at the window, already trying to win the crowd.  All of the pieces are still fitting together, but I sense he has a plan forming. He hasn't accepted his death. He is already fighting hard to stay alive. Which also means that kind Peeta Mellark, the boy who gave me the bread, is fighting hard to kill me."
Hunger Games Chapter 5,"R-i-i-i-p! I grit my teeth as Venia, a woman with aqua hair and gold tattoos above her eyebrows, yanks a strip of Fabric from my leg tearing out the hair beneath it. ""Sorry!"" she pipes in her silly Capitol accent. ""You're just so hairy!""  Why do these people speak in such a high pitch? Why do their jaws barely open when they talk? Why do the ends of their sentences go up as if they're asking a question? Odd vowels, clipped words, and always a hiss on the letter s. no wonder it's impossible not to mimic them.  Venia makes what's supposed to be a sympathetic face. ""Good news, though. This is the last one. Ready?"" I get a grip on the edges of the table I'm seated on and nod. The final swathe of my leg hair is uprooted in a painful jerk.  I've been in the Remake Center for more than three hours and I still haven't met my stylist. Apparently he has no interest in seeing me until Venia and the other members of my prep team have addressed some obvious problems. This has included scrubbing down my body with a gritty loam that has removed not only dirt but at least three layers of skin, turning my nails into uniform shapes, and primarily, ridding my body of hair. My legs, arms, torso, underarms, and parts of my eyebrows have been stripped of the Muff, leaving me like a plucked bird, ready for roasting. I don't like it. My skin feels sore and tingling and intensely vulnerable. But I have kept my side of the bargain with Haymitch, and no objection has crossed my lips.  ""You're doing very well,"" says some guy named Flavius. He gives his orange corkscrew locks a shake and applies a fresh coat of purple lipstick to his mouth. ""If there's one thing we can't stand, it's a whiner. Grease her down!""  Venia and Octavia, a plump woman whose entire body has been dyed a pale shade of pea green, rub me down with a lotion that first stings but then soothes my raw skin. Then they pull me from the table, removing the thin robe I've been allowed to wear off and on. I stand there, completely naked, as the three circle me, wielding tweezers to remove any last bits of hair. I know I should be embarrassed, but they're so unlike people that I'm no more self-conscious than if a trio of oddly colored birds were pecking around my feet.  The three step back and admire their work. ""Excellent! You almost look like a human being now!"" says Flavius, and they all laugh.  I force my lips up into a smile to show how grateful I am. ""Thank you,"" I say sweetly. ""We don't have much cause to look nice in District Twelve.""  This wins them over completely. ""Of course, you don't, you poor darling!"" says Octavia clasping her hands together in distress for me.  ""But don't worry,"" says Venia. ""By the time Cinna is through with you, you're going to be absolutely gorgeous!""  ""We promise! You know, now that we've gotten rid of all the hair and filth, you're not horrible at all!"" says Flavius encouragingly. ""Let's call Cinna!""  They dart out of the room. It's hard to hate my prep team. They're such total idiots. And yet, in an odd way, I know they're sincerely trying to help me.  I look at the cold white walls and floor and resist the impulse to retrieve my robe. But this Cinna, my stylist, will surely make me remove it at once. Instead my hands go to my hairdo, the one area of my body my prep team had been told to leave alone. My fingers stroke the silky braids my mother so carefully arranged. My mother. I left her blue dress and shoes on the floor of my train car, never thinking about retrieving them, of trying to hold on to a piece of her, of home. Now I wish I had.  The door opens and a young man who must be Cinna enters. I'm taken aback by how normal he looks. Most of the stylists they interview on television are so dyed, stenciled, and surgically altered they're grotesque. But Cinna's close-cropped hair appears to be its natural shade of brown. He's in a simple black shirt and pants. The only concession to self-alteration seems to be metallic gold eyeliner that has been applied with a light hand. It brings out the flecks of gold in his green eyes. And, despite my disgust with the Capitol and their hideous fashions, I can't help thinking how attractive it looks.  ""Hello, Katniss. I'm Cinna, your stylist,"" he says in a quiet voice somewhat lacking in the Capitol's affectations.  ""Hello,"" I venture cautiously.  ""Just give me a moment, all right?"" he asks. He walks around my naked body, not touching me, but taking in every inch of it with his eyes. I resist the impulse to cross my arms over my chest. ""Who did your hair?""  ""My mother,"" I say.  ""It's beautiful. Classic really. And in almost perfect balance with your profile. She has very clever fingers,"" he says.  I had expected someone flamboyant, someone older trying desperately to look young, someone who viewed me as a piece of meat to be prepared for a platter. Cinna has met none of these expectations.  ""You're new, aren't you? I don't think I've seen you before,"" I say. Most of the stylists are familiar, constants in the ever-changing pool of tributes. Some have been around my whole life.  ""Yes, this is my first year in the Games,"" says Cinna.  ""So they gave you District Twelve,"" I say. Newcomers generally end up with us, the least desirable district.  ""I asked for District Twelve,"" he says without further explanation. ""Why don't you put on your robe and we'll have a chat.""  Pulling on my robe, I follow him through a door into a sitting room. Two red couches face off over a low table. Three walls are blank, the fourth is entirely glass, providing a window to the city. I can see by the light that it must be around noon, although the sunny sky has turned overcast. Cinna invites me to sit on one of the couches and takes his place across from me. He presses a button on the side of the table. The top splits and from below rises a second tabletop that holds our lunch. Chicken and chunks of oranges cooked in a creamy sauce laid on a bed of pearly white grain, tiny green peas and onions, rolls shaped like flowers, and for dessert, a pudding the color of honey.  I try to imagine assembling this meal myself back home. Chickens are too expensive, but I could make do with a wild turkey. I'd need to shoot a second turkey to trade for an orange. Goat's milk would have to substitute for cream. We can grow peas in the garden. I'd have to get wild onions from the woods. I don't recognize the grain, our own tessera ration cooks down to an unattractive brown mush. Fancy rolls would mean another trade with the baker, perhaps for two or three squirrels. As for the pudding, I can't even guess what's in it. Days of hunting and gathering for this one meal and even then it would be a poor substitution for the Capitol version.  What must it be like, I wonder, to live in a world where food appears at the press of a button? How would I spend the hours I now commit to combing the woods for sustenance if it were so easy to come by? What do they do all day, these people in the Capitol, besides decorating their bodies and waiting around for a new shipment of tributes to roll in and die for their entertainment?  I look up and find Cinna's eyes trained on mine. ""How despicable we must seem to you,"" he says.  Has he seen this in my face or somehow read my thoughts? He's right, though. The whole rotten lot of them is despicable.  ""No matter,"" says Cinna. ""So, Katniss, about your costume for the opening ceremonies. My partner, Portia, is the stylist for your fellow tribute, Peeta. And our current thought is to dress you in complementary costumes,"" says Cinna. ""As you know, it's customary to reflect the flavor of the district.""  For the opening ceremonies, you're supposed to wear something that suggests your district's principal industry. District 11, agriculture. District 4, fishing. District 3, factories. This means that coming from District 12, Peeta and I will be in some kind of coal miner's getup. Since the baggy miner's jumpsuits are not particularly becoming, our tributes usually end up in skimpy outfits and hats with headlamps. One year, our tributes were stark naked and covered in black powder to represent coal dust. It's always dreadful and does nothing to win favor with the crowd. I prepare myself for the worst.  ""So, I'll be in a coal miner outfit?"" I ask, hoping it won't be indecent.  ""Not exactly. You see, Portia and I think that coal miner thing's very overdone. No one will remember you in that. And we both see it as our job to make the District Twelve tributes unforgettable,"" says Cinna.  I'll be naked for sure, I think.  ""So rather than focus on the coal mining itself, we're going to focus on the coal,"" says Cinna. Naked and covered in black dust, I think. ""And what do we do with coal? We burn it,"" says Cinna.  ""You're not afraid of fire, are you, Katniss?"" He sees my expression and grins.  A few hours later, I am dressed in what will either be the most sensational or the deadliest costume in the opening ceremonies. I'm in a simple black unitard that covers me from ankle to neck. Shiny leather boots lace up to my knees. But it's the fluttering cape made of streams of orange, yellow, and red and the matching headpiece that define this costume. Cinna plans to light them on fire just before our chariot rolls into the streets.  ""It's not real flame, of course, just a little synthetic fire Portia and I came up with. You'll be perfectly safe,"" he says. But I'm not convinced I won't be perfectly barbecued by the time we reach the city's center.  My face is relatively clear of makeup, just a bit of highlighting here and there. My hair has been brushed out and then braided down my back in my usual style. ""I want the audience to recognize you when you're in the arena,"" says Cinna dreamily. ""Katniss, the girl who was on fire.""  It crosses my mind that Cinna's calm and normal demeanor masks a complete madman.  Despite this morning's revelation about Peeta's character, I'm actually relieved when he shows up, dressed in an identical costume. He should know about fire, being a baker's son and all. His stylist, Portia, and her team accompany him in, and everyone is absolutely giddy with excitement over what a splash we'll make. Except Cinna. He just seems a bit weary as he accepts congratulations.  We're whisked down to the bottom level of the Remake Center, which is essentially a gigantic stable. The opening ceremonies are about to start. Pairs of tributes are being loaded into chariots pulled by teams of four horses. Ours are coal black. The animals are so well trained, no one even needs to guide their reins. Cinna and Portia direct us into the chariot and carefully arrange our body positions, the drape of our capes, before moving off to consult with each other.  ""What do you think?"" I whisper to Peeta. ""About the fire?""  ""I'll rip off your cape if you'll rip off mine,"" he says through gritted teeth.  ""Deal,"" I say. Maybe, if we can get them off soon enough, we'll avoid the worst burns. It's bad though. They'll throw us into the arena no matter what condition we're in. ""I know we promised Haymitch we'd do exactly what they said, but I don't think he considered this angle.""  ""Where is Haymitch, anyway? Isn't he supposed to protect us from this sort of thing?"" says Peeta.  ""With all that alcohol in him, it's probably not advisable to have him around an open flame,"" I say.  And suddenly we're both laughing. I guess we're both so nervous about the Games and more pressingly, petrified of being turned into human torches, we're not acting sensibly.  The opening music begins. It's easy to hear, blasted around the Capitol. Massive doors slide open revealing the crowd-lined streets. The ride lasts about twenty minutes and ends up at the City Circle, where they will welcome us, play the anthem, and escort us into the Training Center, which will be our home/prison until the Games begin.  The tributes from District 1 ride out in a chariot pulled by snow-white horses. They look so beautiful, spray-painted silver, in tasteful tunics glittering with jewels. District 1 makes luxury items for the Capitol. You can hear the roar of the crowd. They are always favorites.  District 2 gets into position to follow them. In no time at all, we are approaching the door and I can see that between the overcast sky and evening hour the light is turning gray. The tributes from District 11 are just rolling out when Cinna appears with a lighted torch. ""Here we go then,"" he says, and before we can react he sets our capes on fire. I gasp, waiting for the heat, but there is only a faint tickling sensation. Cinna climbs up before us and ignites our headdresses. He lets out a sign of relief. ""It works."" Then he gently tucks a hand under my chin. ""Remember, heads high. Smiles. They're going to love you!""  Cinna jumps off the chariot and has one last idea. He shouts something up at us, but the music drowns him out. He shouts again and gestures.  ""What's he saying?"" I ask Peeta. For the first time, I look at him and realize that ablaze with the fake flames, he is dazzling. And I must be, too.  ""I think he said for us to hold hands,"" says Peeta. He grabs my right hand in his left, and we look to Cinna for confirmation. He nods and gives a thumbs-up, and that's the last thing I see before we enter the city.  The crowd's initial alarm at our appearance quickly changes to cheers and shouts of ""District Twelve!"" Every head is turned our way, pulling the focus from the three chariots ahead of us. At first, I'm frozen, but then I catch sight of us on a large television screen and am floored by how breathtaking we look. In the deepening twilight, the firelight illuminates our faces. We seem to be leaving a trail of fire off the flowing capes. Cinna was right about the minimal makeup, we both look more attractive but utterly recognizable.  Remember, heads high. Smiles. They're going to love you! I hear Cinna's voice in my head. I lift my chin a bit higher, put on my most winning smile, and wave with my free hand. I'm glad now I have Peeta to clutch for balance, he is so steady, solid as a rock. As I gain confidence, I actually blow a few kisses to the crowd. The people of the Capitol are going nuts, showering us with flowers, shouting our names, our first names, which they have bothered to find on the program.  The pounding music, the cheers, the admiration work their way into my blood, and I can't suppress my excitement. Cinna has given me a great advantage. No one will forget me. Not my look, not my name. Katniss. The girl who was on fire.  For the first time, I feel a flicker of hope rising up in me. Surely, there must be one sponsor willing to take me on! And with a little extra help, some food, the right weapon, why should I count myself out of the Games?  Someone throws me a red rose. I catch it, give it a delicate sniff, and blow a kiss back in the general direction of the giver. A hundred hands reach up to catch my kiss, as if it were a real and tangible thing.  ""Katniss! Katniss!"" I can hear my name being called from all sides. Everyone wants my kisses.  It's not until we enter the City Circle that I realize I must have completely stopped the circulation in Peeta's hand. That's how tightly I've been holding it. I look down at our linked fingers as I loosen my grasp, but he regains his grip on me. ""No, don't let go of me,"" he says. The firelight flickers off his blue eyes. ""Please. I might fall out of this thing.""  ""Okay,"" I say. So I keep holding on, but I can't help feeling strange about the way Cinna has linked us together. It's not really fair to present us as a team and then lock us into the arena to kill each other.  The twelve chariots fill the loop of the City Circle. On the buildings that surround the Circle, every window is packed with the most prestigious citizens of the Capitol. Our horses pull our chariot right up to President Snow's mansion, and we come to a halt. The music ends with a flourish.  The president, a small, thin man with paper-white hair, gives the official welcome from a balcony above us. It is traditional to cut away to the faces of the tributes during the speech. But I can see on the screen that we are getting way more than our share of airtime. The darker it becomes, the more difficult it is to take your eyes off our flickering. When the national anthem plays, they do make an effort to do a quick cut around to each pair of tributes, but the camera holds on the District 12 chariot as it parades around the circle one final time and disappears into the Training Center.  The doors have only just shut behind us when we're engulfed by the prep teams, who are nearly unintelligible as they babble out praise. As I glance around, I notice a lot of the other tributes are shooting us dirty looks, which confirms what I've suspected, we've literally outshone them all. Then Cinna and Portia are there, helping us down from the chariot, carefully removing our flaming capes and headdresses. Portia extinguishes them with some kind of spray from a canister.  I realize I'm still glued to Peeta and force my stiff fingers to open. We both massage our hands.  ""Thanks for keeping hold of me. I was getting a little shaky there,"" says Peeta.  ""It didn't show,"" I tell him. ""I'm sure no one noticed.""  ""I'm sure they didn't notice anything but you. You should wear flames more often,"" he says. ""They suit you."" And then he gives me a smile that seems so genuinely sweet with just the right touch of shyness that unexpected warmth rushes through me.  A warning bell goes off in my head. Don't be so stupid. Peeta is planning how to kill you, I remind myself. He is luring you in to make you easy prey. The more likable he is, the more deadly he is.  But because two can play at this game, I stand on tiptoe and kiss his cheek. Right on his bruise."
Hunger Games Chapter 6,"The Training Center has a tower designed exclusively for the tributes and their teams. This will be our home until the actual Games begin. Each district has an entire floor. You simply step onto an elevator and press the number of your district. Easy enough to remember.  I've ridden the elevator a couple of times in the Justice Building back in District 12. Once to receive the medal for my father's death and then yesterday to say my final goodbyes to my friends and family. But that's a dark and creaky thing that moves like a snail and smells of sour milk. The walls of this elevator are made of crystal so that you can watch the people on the ground floor shrink to ants as you shoot up into the air. It's exhilarating and I'm tempted to ask Effie Trinket if we can ride it again, but somehow that seems childish.  Apparently, Effie Trinket's duties did not conclude at the station. She and Haymitch will be overseeing us right into the arena. In a way, that's a plus because at least she can be counted on to corral us around to places on time whereas we haven't seen Haymitch since he agreed to help us on the train. Probably passed out somewhere. Effie Trinket, on the other hand, seems to be flying high. We're the first team she's ever chaperoned that made a splash at the opening ceremonies. She's complimentary about not just our costumes but how we conducted ourselves. And, to hear her tell it, Effie knows everyone who's anyone in the Capitol and has been talking us up all day, trying to win us sponsors.  ""I've been very mysterious, though,"" she says, her eyes squint half shut. ""Because, of course, Haymitch hasn't bothered to tell me your strategies. But I've done my best with what I had to work with. How Katniss sacrificed herself for her sister. How you've both successfully struggled to overcome the barbarism of your district.""  Barbarism? That's ironic coming from a woman helping to prepare us for slaughter. And what's she basing our success on? Our table manners?  ""Everyone has their reservations, naturally. You being from the coal district. But I said, and this was very clever of me, I said, 'Well, if you put enough pressure on coal it turns to pearls!'"" Effie beams at us so brilliantly that we have no choice but to respond enthusiastically to her cleverness even though it's wrong.  Coal doesn't turn to pearls. They grow in shellfish. Possibly she meant coal turns to diamonds, but that's untrue, too. I've heard they have some sort of machine in District 1 that can turn graphite into diamonds. But we don't mine graphite in District 12. That was part of District 13's job until they were destroyed.  I wonder if the people she's been plugging us to all day either know or care.  ""Unfortunately, I can't seal the sponsor deals for you. Only Haymitch can do that,"" says Effie grimly. ""But don't worry, I'll get him to the table at gunpoint if necessary.""  Although lacking in many departments, Effie Trinket has a certain determination I have to admire.  My quarters are larger than our entire house back home. They are plush, like the train car, but also have so many automatic gadgets that I'm sure I won't have time to press all the buttons. The shower alone has a panel with more than a hundred options you can choose regulating water temperature, pressure, soaps, shampoos, scents, oils, and massaging sponges. When you step out on a mat, heaters come on that blow-dry your body. Instead of struggling with the knots in my wet hair, I merely place my hand on a box that sends a current through my scalp, untangling, parting, and drying my hair almost instantly. It floats down around my shoulders in a glossy curtain.  I program the closet for an outfit to my taste. The windows zoom in and out on parts of the city at my command. You need only whisper a type of food from a gigantic menu into a mouthpiece and it appears, hot and steamy, before you in less than a minute. I walk around the room eating goose liver and puffy bread until there's a knock on the door. Effie's calling me to dinner.  Good. I'm starving.  Peeta, Cinna, and Portia are standing out on a balcony that overlooks the Capitol when we enter the dining room. I'm glad to see the stylists, particularly after I hear that Haymitch will be joining us. A meal presided over by just Effie and Haymitch is bound to be a disaster. Besides, dinner isn't really about food, it's about planning out our strategies, and Cinna and Portia have already proven how valuable they are.  A silent young man dressed in a white tunic offers us all stemmed glasses of wine. I think about turning it down, but I've never had wine, except the homemade stuff my mother uses for coughs, and when will I get a chance to try it again? I take a sip of the tart, dry liquid and secretly think it could be improved by a few spoonfuls of honey.  Haymitch shows up just as dinner is being served. It looks as if he's had his own stylist because he's clean and groomed and about as sober as I've ever seen him. He doesn't refuse the offer of wine, but when he starts in on his soup, I realize it's the first time I've ever seen him eat. Maybe he really will pull himself together long enough to help us.  Cinna and Portia seem to have a civilizing effect on Haymitch and Effie. At least they're addressing each other decently. And they both have nothing but praise for our stylists' opening act. While they make small talk, I concentrate on the meal. Mushroom soup, bitter greens with tomatoes the size of peas, rare roast beef sliced as thin as paper, noodles in a green sauce, cheese that melts on your tongue served with sweet blue grapes. The servers, all young people dressed in white tunics like the one who gave us wine, move wordlessly to and from the table, keeping the platters and glasses full.  About halfway through my glass of wine, my head starts feeling foggy, so I change to water instead. I don't like the feeling and hope it wears off soon. How Haymitch can stand walking around like this full-time is a mystery.  I try to focus on the talk, which has turned to our interview costumes, when a girl sets a gorgeous-looking cake on the table and deftly lights it. It blazes up and then the flames flicker around the edges awhile until it finally goes out. I have a moment of doubt. ""What makes it burn? Is it alcohol?"" I say, looking up at the girl. ""That's the last thing I wa  -  oh! I know you!""  I can't place a name or time to the girl's face. But I'm certain of it. The dark red hair, the striking features, the porcelain white skin. But even as I utter the words, I feel my insides contracting with anxiety and guilt at the sight of her, and while I can't pull it up, I know some bad memory is associated with her. The expression of terror that crosses her face only adds to my confusion and unease. She shakes her head in denial quickly and hurries away from the table.  When I look back, the four adults are watching me like hawks.  ""Don't be ridiculous, Katniss. How could you possibly know an Avox?"" snaps Effie. ""The very thought.""  ""What's an Avox?"" I ask stupidly.  ""Someone who committed a crime. They cut her tongue so she can't speak,"" says Haymitch. ""She's probably a traitor of some sort. Not likely you'd know her.""  ""And even if you did, you're not to speak to one of them unless it's to give an order,"" says Effie. ""Of course, you don't really know her.""  But I do know her. And now that Haymitch has mentioned the word traitor I remember from where. The disapproval is so high I could never admit it. ""No, I guess not, I just  - "" I stammer, and the wine is not helping.  Peeta snaps his fingers. ""Delly Cartwright. That's who it is. I kept thinking she looked familiar as well. Then I realized she's a dead ringer for Delly.""  Delly Cartwright is a pasty-faced, lumpy girl with yellowish hair who looks about as much like our server as a beetle does a butterfly. She may also be the friendliest person on the planet  -  she smiles constantly at everybody in school, even me. I have never seen the girl with the red hair smile. But I jump on Peeta's suggestion gratefully. ""Of course, that's who I was thinking of. It must be the hair,"" I say.  ""Something about the eyes, too,"" says Peeta.  The energy at the table relaxes. ""Oh, well. If that's all it is,"" says Cinna. ""And yes, the cake has spirits, but all the alcohol has burned off. I ordered it specially in honor of your fiery debut.""  We eat the cake and move into a sitting room to watch the replay of the opening ceremonies that's being broadcast. A few of the other couples make a nice impression, but none of them can hold a candle to us. Even our own party lets out an ""Ahh!"" as they show us coming out of the Remake Center.  ""Whose idea was the hand holding?"" asks Haymitch.  ""Cinna's,"" says Portia.  ""Just the perfect touch of rebellion,"" says Haymitch. ""Very nice.""  Rebellion? I have to think about that one a moment. But when I remember the other couples, standing stiffly apart, never touching or acknowledging each other, as if their fellow tribute did not exist, as if the Games had already begun, I know what Haymitch means. Presenting ourselves not as adversaries but as friends has distinguished us as much as the fiery costumes.  ""Tomorrow morning is the first training session. Meet me for breakfast and I'll tell you exactly how I want you to play it,"" says Haymitch to Peeta and I. ""Now go get some sleep while the grown-ups talk.""  Peeta and I walk together down the corridor to our rooms. When we get to my door, he leans against the frame, not blocking my entrance exactly but insisting I pay attention to him. ""So, Delly Cartwright. Imagine finding her lookalike here.""  He's asking for an explanation, and I'm tempted to give him one. We both know he covered for me. So here I am in his debt again. If I tell him the truth about the girl, somehow that might even things up. How can it hurt really? Even if he repeated the story, it couldn't do me much harm. It was just something I witnessed. And he lied as much as I did about Delly Cartwright.  I realize I do want to talk to someone about the girl. Someone who might be able to help me figure out her story.  Gale would be my first choice, but it's unlikely I'll ever see Gale again. I try to think if telling Peeta could give him any possible advantage over me, but I don't see how. Maybe sharing a confidence will actually make him believe I see him as a friend.  Besides, the idea of the girl with her maimed tongue frightens me. She has reminded me why I'm here. Not to model flashy costumes and eat delicacies. But to die a bloody death while the crowds urge on my killer.  To tell or not to tell? My brain still feels slow from the wine. I stare down the empty corridor as if the decision lies there.  Peeta picks up on my hesitation. ""Have you been on the roof yet?"" I shake my head. ""Cinna showed me. You can practically see the whole city. The wind's a bit loud, though.""  I translate this into ""No one will overhear us talking"" in my head. You do have the sense that we might be under surveillance here. ""Can we just go up?""  ""Sure, come on,"" says Peeta. I follow him to a flight of stairs that lead to the roof. There's a small dome-shaped room with a door to the outside. As we step into the cool, windy evening air, I catch my breath at the view. The Capitol twinkles like a vast field of fireflies. Electricity in District 12 comes and goes, usually we only have it a few hours a day. Often the evenings are spent in candlelight. The only time you can count on it is when they're airing the Games or some important government message on television that it's mandatory to watch. But here there would be no shortage. Ever.  Peeta and I walk to a railing at the edge of the roof. I look straight down the side of the building to the street, which is buzzing with people. You can hear their cars, an occasional shout, and a strange metallic tinkling. In District 12, we'd all be thinking about bed right now.  ""I asked Cinna why they let us up here. Weren't they worried that some of the tributes might decide to jump right over the side?"" says Peeta.  ""What'd he say?"" I ask.  ""You can't,"" says Peeta. He holds out his hand into seemingly empty space. There's a sharp zap and he jerks it back. ""Some kind of electric field throws you back on the roof.""  ""Always worried about our safety,"" I say. Even though Cinna has shown Peeta the roof, I wonder if we're supposed to be up here now, so late and alone. I've never seen tributes on the Training Center roof before. But that doesn't mean we're not being taped. ""Do you think they're watching us now?""  ""Maybe,"" he admits. ""Come see the garden.""  On the other side of the dome, they've built a garden with flower beds and potted trees. From the branches hang hundreds of wind chimes, which account for the tinkling I heard. Here in the garden, on this windy night, it's enough to drown out two people who are trying not to be heard. Peeta looks at me expectantly.  I pretend to examine a blossom. ""We were hunting in the woods one day. Hidden, waiting for game,"" I whisper.  ""You and your father?"" he whispers back.  ""No, my friend Gale. Suddenly all the birds stopped singing at once. Except one. As if it were giving a warning call. And then we saw her. I'm sure it was the same girl. A boy was with her. Their clothes were tattered. They had dark circles under their eyes from no sleep. They were running as if their lives depended on it,"" I say.  For a moment I'm silent, as I remember how the sight of this strange pair, clearly not from District 12, fleeing through the woods immobilized us. Later, we wondered if we could have helped them escape. Perhaps we might have. Concealed them. If we'd moved quickly. Gale and I were taken by surprise, yes, but we're both hunters. We know how animals look at bay. We knew the pair was in trouble as soon as we saw them. But we only watched.  ""The hovercraft appeared out of nowhere,"" I continue to Peeta. ""I mean, one moment the sky was empty and the next it was there. It didn't make a sound, but they saw it. A net dropped down on the girl and carried her up, fast, so fast like the elevator. They shot some sort of spear through the boy. It was attached to a cable and they hauled him up as well. But I'm certain he was dead. We heard the girl scream once. The boy's name, I think. Then it was gone, the hovercraft. Vanished into thin air. And the birds began to sing again, as if nothing had happened.""  ""Did they see you?"" Peeta asked.  ""I don't know. We were under a shelf of rock,"" I reply.  But I do know. There was a moment, after the birdcall, but before the hovercraft, where the girl had seen us. She'd locked eyes with me and called out for help. But neither Gale or I had responded.  ""You're shivering,"" says Peeta.  The wind and the story have blown all the warmth from my body. The girl's scream. Had it been her last?  Peeta takes off his jacket and wraps it around my shoulders. I start to take a step back, but then I let him, deciding for a moment to accept both his jacket and his kindness. A friend would do that, right?  ""They were from here?"" he asks, and he secures a button at my neck.  I nod. They'd had that Capitol look about them. The boy and the girl.  ""Where do you suppose they were going?"" he asks.  ""I don't know that,"" I say. District 12 is pretty much the end of the line. Beyond us, there's only wilderness. If you don't count the ruins of District 13 that still smolder from the toxic bombs. They show it on television occasionally, just to remind us. ""Or why they would leave here."" Haymitch had called the Avoxes traitors. Against what? It could only be the Capitol. But they had everything here. No cause to rebel.  ""I'd leave here,"" Peeta blurts out. Then he looks around nervously. It was loud enough to hear above the chimes. He laughs. ""I'd go home now if they let me. But you have to admit, the food's prime.""  He's covered again. If that's all you'd heard it would just sound like the words of a scared tribute, not someone contemplating the unquestionable goodness of the Capitol.  ""It's getting chilly. We better go in,"" he says. Inside the dome, it's warm and bright. His tone is conversational. ""Your friend Gale. He's the one who took your sister away at the reaping?""  ""Yes. Do you know him?"" I ask.  ""Not really. I hear the girls talk about him a lot. I thought he was your cousin or something. You favor each other,"" he says.  ""No, we're not related,"" I say.  Peeta nods, unreadable. ""Did he come to say good-bye to you?""  ""Yes,"" I say, observing him carefully. ""So did your father. He brought me cookies.""  Peeta raises his eyebrows as if this is news. But after watching him lie so smoothly, I don't give this much weight. ""Really? Well, he likes you and your sister. I think he wishes he had a daughter instead of a houseful of boys.""  The idea that I might ever have been discussed, around the dinner table, at the bakery fire, just in passing in Peeta's house gives me a start. It must have been when the mother was out of the room.  ""He knew your mother when they were kids,"" says Peeta.  Another surprise. But probably true. ""Oh, yes. She grew up in town,"" I say. It seems impolite to say she never mentioned the baker except to compliment his bread.  We're at my door. I give back his jacket. ""See you in the morning then.""  ""See you,"" he says, and walks off down the hall.  When I open my door, the redheaded girl is collecting my unitard and boots from where I left them on the floor before my shower. I want to apologize for possibly getting her in trouble earlier. But I remember I'm not supposed to speak to her unless I'm giving her an order.  ""Oh, sorry,"" I say. ""I was supposed to get those back to Cinna. I'm sorry. Can you take them to him?""  She avoids my eyes, gives a small nod, and heads out the door.  I'd set out to tell her I was sorry about dinner. But I know that my apology runs much deeper. That I'm ashamed I never tried to help her in the woods. That I let the Capitol kill the boy and mutilate her without lifting a finger.  Just like I was watching the Games.  I kick off my shoes and climb under the covers in my clothes. The shivering hasn't stopped. Perhaps the girl doesn't even remember me. But I know she does. You don't forget the face of the person who was your last hope. I pull the covers up over my head as if this will protect me from the redheaded girl who can't speak. But I can feel her eyes staring at me, piercing through walls and doors and bedding.  I wonder if she'll enjoy watching me die."
Hunger Games Chapter 7,"My slumbers are filled with disturbing dreams. The face of the redheaded girl intertwines with gory images from earlier Hunger Games, with my mother withdrawn and unreachable, with Prim emaciated and terrified. I bolt up screaming for my father to run as the mine explodes into a million deadly bits of light.  Dawn is breaking through the windows. The Capitol has a misty, haunted air. My head aches and I must have bitten into the side of my cheek in the night. My tongue probes the ragged flesh and I taste blood.  Slowly, I drag myself out of bed and into the shower. I arbitrarily punch buttons on the control board and end up hopping from foot to foot as alternating jets of icy cold and steaming hot water assault me. Then I'm deluged in lemony foam that I have to scrape off with a heavy bristled brush. Oh, well. At least my blood is flowing.  When I'm dried and moisturized with lotion, I find an outfit has been left for me at the front of the closet. Tight black pants, a long-sleeved burgundy tunic, and leather shoes. I put my hair in the single braid down my back. This is the first time since the morning of the reaping that I resemble myself. No fancy hair and clothes, no flaming capes. Just me. Looking like I could be headed for the woods. It calms me.  Haymitch didn't give us an exact time to meet for breakfast and no one has contacted me this morning, but I'm hungry so I head down to the dining room, hoping there will be food. I'm not disappointed. While the table is empty, a long board off to the side has been laid with at least twenty dishes. A young man, an Avox, stands at attention by the spread. When I ask if I can serve myself, he nods assent. I load a plate with eggs, sausages, batter cakes covered in thick orange preserves, slices of pale purple melon. As I gorge myself, I watch the sun rise over the Capitol. I have a second plate of hot grain smothered in beef stew. Finally, I fill a plate with rolls and sit at the table, breaking oil bits and dipping them into hot chocolate, the way Peeta did on the train.  My mind wanders to my mother and Prim. They must be up. My mother getting their breakfast of mush. Prim milking her goat before school. Just two mornings ago, I was home. Can that be right? Yes, just two. And now how empty the house feels, even from a distance. What did they say last night about my fiery debut at the Games? Did it give them hope, or simply add to their terror when they saw the reality of twenty-four tributes circled together, knowing only one could live?  Haymitch and Peeta come in, bid me good morning, fill their plates. It makes me irritated that Peeta is wearing exactly the same outfit I am. I need to say something to Cinna. This twins act is going to blow up in out faces once the Games begin. Surely, they must know this. Then I remember Haymitch telling me to do exactly what the stylists tell me to do. If it was anyone but Cinna, I might be tempted to ignore him. But after last night's triumph, I don't have a lot of room to criticize his choices.  I'm nervous about the training. There will be three days in which all the tributes practice together. On the last afternoon, we'll each get a chance to perform in private before the Gamemakers. The thought of meeting the other tributes face-to-face makes me queasy. I turn the roll I have just taken from the basket over and over in my hands, but my appetite is gone.  When Haymitch has finished several platters of stew, he pushes back his plate with a sigh. He takes a flask from his pocket and takes a long pull on it and leans his elbows on the table. ""So, let's get down to business. Training. First off, if you like, I'll coach you separately. Decide now.""  ""Why would you coach us separately?"" I ask.  ""Say if you had a secret skill you might not want the other to know about,"" says Haymitch.  I exchange a look with Peeta. ""I don't have any secret skills,"" he says. ""And I already know what yours is, right? I mean, I've eaten enough of your squirrels.""  I never thought about Peeta eating the squirrels I shot. Somehow I always pictured the baker quietly going off and frying them up for himself. Not out of greed. But because town families usually eat expensive butcher meat. Beef and chicken and horse.  ""You can coach us together,"" I tell Haymitch. Peeta nods.  ""All right, so give me some idea of what you can do,"" says Haymitch.  ""I can't do anything,"" says Peeta. ""Unless you count baking bread.""  ""Sorry, I don't. Katniss. I already know you're handy with a knife,"" says Haymitch.  ""Not really. But I can hunt,"" I say. ""With a bow and arrow.""  ""And you're good?"" asks Haymitch.  I have to think about it. I've been putting food on the table for four years. That's no small task. I'm not as good as my father was, but he'd had more practice. I've better aim than Gale, but I've had more practice. He's a genius with traps and snares. ""I'm all right,"" I say.  ""She's excellent,"" says Peeta. ""My father buys her squirrels. He always comments on how the arrows never pierce the body. She hits every one in the eye. It's the same with the rabbits she sells the butcher. She can even bring down deer.""  This assessment of my skills from Peeta takes me totally by surprise. First, that he ever noticed. Second, that he's talking me up. ""What are you doing?"" I ask him suspiciously.  ""What are you doing? If he's going to help you, he has to know what you're capable of. Don't underrate yourself,"" says Peeta.  I don't know why, but this rubs me the wrong way. ""What about you? I've seen you in the market. You can lift hundred-pound bags of flour,"" I snap at him. ""Tell him that. That's not nothing.""  ""Yes, and I'm sure the arena will be full of bags of flour for me to chuck at people. It's not like being able to use a weapon. You know it isn't,"" he shoots back.  ""He can wrestle,"" I tell Haymitch. ""He came in second in our school competition last year, only after his brother.""  ""What use is that? How many times have you seen someone wrestle someone to death?"" says Peeta in disgust.  ""There's always hand-to-hand combat. All you need is to come up with a knife, and you'll at least stand a chance. If I get jumped, I'm dead!"" I can hear my voice rising in anger.  ""But you won't! You'll be living up in some tree eating raw squirrels and picking off people with arrows. You know what my mother said to me when she came to say good-bye, as if to cheer me up, she says maybe District Twelve will finally have a winner. Then I realized, she didn't mean me, she meant you!"" bursts out Peeta.  ""Oh, she meant you,"" I say with a wave of dismissal.  ""She said, 'She's a survivor, that one.' She is,"" says Peeta.  That pulls me up short. Did his mother really say that about me? Did she rate me over her son? I see the pain in Peeta's eyes and know he isn't lying.  Suddenly I'm behind the bakery and I can feel the chill of the rain running down my back, the hollowness in my belly. I sound eleven years old when I speak. ""But only because someone helped me.""  Peeta's eyes flicker down to the roll in my hands, and I know he remembers that day, too. But he just shrugs. ""People will help you in the arena. They'll be tripping over each other to sponsor you.""  ""No more than you,"" I say.  Peeta rolls his eyes at Haymitch. ""She has no idea. The effect she can have."" He runs his fingernail along the wood grain in the table, refusing to look at me.  What on earth does he mean? People help me? When we were dying of starvation, no one helped me! No one except Peeta. Once I had something to barter with, things changed. I'm a tough trader. Or am I? What effect do I have? That I'm weak and needy? Is he suggesting that I got good deals because people pitied me? I try to think if this is true. Perhaps some of the merchants were a little generous in their trades, but I always attributed that to their long-standing relationship with my father. Besides, my game is first-class. No one pitied me!  I glower at the roll sure he meant to insult me.  After about a minute of this, Haymitch says, ""Well, then. Well, well, well. Katniss, there's no guarantee they'll be bows and arrows in the arena, but during your private session with the Gamemakers, show them what you can do. Until then, stay clear of archery. Are you any good at trapping?""  ""I know a few basic snares,"" I mutter.  ""That may be significant in terms of food,"" says Haymitch. ""And Peeta, she's right, never underestimate strength in the arena. Very often, physical power tilts the advantage to a player. In the Training Center, they will have weights, but don't reveal how much you can lift in front of the other tributes. The plan's the same for both of you. You go to group training. Spend the time trying to learn something you don't know. Throw a spear. Swing a mace. Learn to tie a decent knot. Save showing what you're best at until your private sessions. Are we clear?"" says Haymitch. Peeta and I nod.  ""One last thing. In public, I want you by each other's side every minute,"" says Haymitch. We both start to object, but Haymitch slams his hand on the table. ""Every minute! It's not open for discussion! You agreed to do as I said! You will be together, you will appear amiable to each other. Now get out. Meet Effie at the elevator at ten for training.""  I bite my lip and stalk back to my room, making sure Peeta can hear the door slam. I sit on the bed, hating Haymitch, hating Peeta, hating myself for mentioning that day long ago in the rain.  It's such a joke! Peeta and I going along pretending to be friends! Talking up each other's strengths, insisting the other take credit for their abilities. Because, in fact, at some point, we're going to have to knock it off and accept we're bitter adversaries. Which I'd be prepared to do right now if it wasn't for Haymitch's stupid instruction that we stick together in training. It's my own fault, I guess, for telling him he didn't have to coach us separately. But that didn't mean I wanted to do everything with Peeta. Who, by the way, clearly doesn't want to be partnering up with me, either.  I hear Peeta's voice in my head. She has no idea. The effect she can have. Obviously meant to demean me. Right? but a tiny part of me wonders if this was a compliment. That he meant I was appealing in some way. It's weird, how much he's noticed me. Like the attention he's paid to my hunting. And apparently, I have not been as oblivious to him as I imagined, either. The flour. The wrestling. I have kept track of the boy with the bread.  It's almost ten. I clean my teeth and smooth back my hair again. Anger temporarily blocked out my nervousness about meeting the other tributes, but now I can feel my anxiety rising again. By the time I meet Effie and Peeta at the elevator, I catch myself biting my nails. I stop at once.  The actual training rooms are below ground level of our building. With these elevators, the ride is less than a minute. The doors open into an enormous gymnasium filled with various weapons and obstacle courses. Although it's not yet ten, we're the last ones to arrive. The other tributes are gathered in a tense circle. They each have a cloth square with their district number on it pinned to their shirts. While someone pins the number 12 on my back, I do a quick assessment. Peeta and I are the only two dressed alike.  As soon as we join the circle, the head trainer, a tall, athletic woman named Atala steps up and begins to explain the training schedule. Experts in each skill will remain at their stations. We will be free to travel from area to area as we choose, per our mentor's instructions. Some of the stations teach survival skills, others fighting techniques. We are forbidden to engage in any combative exercise with another tribute. There are assistants on hand if we want to practice with a partner.  When Atala begins to read down the list of the skill stations, my eyes can't help flitting around to the other tributes. It's the first time we've been assembled, on level ground, in simple clothes. My heart sinks. Almost all of the boys and at least half of the girls are bigger than I am, even though many of the tributes have never been fed properly. You can see it in their bones, their skin, the hollow look in their eyes. I may be smaller naturally, but overall my family's resourcefulness has given me an edge in that area. I stand straight, and while I'm thin, I'm strong. The meat and plants from the woods combined with the exertion it took to get them have given me a healthier body than most of those I see around me.  The exceptions are the kids from the wealthier districts, the volunteers, the ones who have been fed and trained throughout their lives for this moment. The tributes from 1, 2, and 4 traditionally have this look about them. It's technically against the rules to train tributes before they reach the Capitol but it happens every year. In District 12, we call them the Career Tributes, or just the Careers. And like as not, the winner will be one of them.  The slight advantage I held coming into the Training Center, my fiery entrance last night, seems to vanish in the presence of my competition. The other tributes were jealous of us, but not because we were amazing, because our stylists were. Now I see nothing but contempt in the glances of the Career Tributes. Each must have fifty to a hundred pounds on me. They project arrogance and brutality. When Atala releases us, they head straight for the deadliest-looking weapons in the gym and handle them with ease.  I'm thinking that it's lucky I'm a fast runner when Peeta nudges my arm and I jump. He is still beside me, per Haymitch's instructions. His expression is sober. ""Where would you like to start?""  I look around at the Career Tributes who are showing off, clearly trying to intimidate the field. Then at the others, the underfed, the incompetent, shakily having their first lessons with a knife or an ax.  ""Suppose we tie some knots,"" I say.  ""Right you are,"" says Peeta. We cross to an empty station where the trainer seems pleased to have students. You get the feeling that the knot-tying class is not the Hunger games hot spot. When he realizes I know something about snares, he shows us a simple, excellent trap that will leave a human competitor dangling by a leg from a tree. We concentrate on this one skill for an hour until both of us have mastered it. Then we move on to camouflage. Peeta genuinely seems to enjoy this station, swirling a combination of mud and clay and berry juices around on his pale skin, weaving disguises from vines and leaves. The trainer who runs the camouflage station is full of enthusiasm at his work.  ""I do the cakes,"" he admits to me.  ""The cakes?"" I ask. I've been preoccupied with watching the boy from District 2 send a spear through a dummy's heart from fifteen yards. ""What cakes?""  ""At home. The iced ones, for the bakery,"" he says.  He means the ones they display in the windows. Fancy cakes with flowers and pretty things painted in frosting. They're for birthdays and New Year's Day. When we're in the square, Prim always drags me over to admire them, although we'd never be able to afford one. There's little enough beauty in District 12, though, so I can hardly deny her this.  I look more critically at the design on Peeta's arm. The alternating pattern of light and dark suggests sunlight falling through the leaves in the woods. I wonder how he knows this, since I doubt he's ever been beyond the fence. Has he been able to pick this up from just that scraggly old apple tree in his backyard? Somehow the whole thing  -  his skill, those inaccessible cakes, the praise of the camouflage expert  -  annoys me.  ""It's lovely. If only you could frost someone to death,"" I say.  ""Don't be so superior. You can never tell what you'll find in the arena. Say it's actually a gigantic cake  - "" begins Peeta.  ""Say we move on,"" I break in.  So the next three days pass with Peeta and I going quietly from station to station. We do pick up some valuable skills, from starting fires, to knife throwing, to making shelter. Despite Haymitch's order to appear mediocre, Peeta excels in hand-to-hand combat, and I sweep the edible plants test without blinking an eye. We steer clear of archery and weightlifting though, wanting to save those for our private sessions.  The Gamemakers appeared early on the first day. Twenty or so men and women dressed in deep purple robes. They sit in the elevated stands that surround the gymnasium, sometimes wandering about to watch us, jotting down notes, other times eating at the endless banquet that has been set for them, ignoring the lot of us. But they do seem to be keeping their eye on the District 12 tributes. Several times I've looked up to find one fixated on me. They consult with the trainers during our meals as well. We see them all gathered together when we come back.  Breakfast and dinner are served on our floor, but at lunch the twenty-four of us eat in a dining room off the gymnasium. Food is arranged on carts around the room and you serve yourself. The Career Tributes tend to gather rowdily around one table, as if to prove their superiority, that they have no fear of one another and consider the rest of us beneath notice. Most of the other tributes sit alone, like lost sheep. No one says a word to us. Peeta and I eat together, and since Haymitch keeps dogging us about it, try to keep up a friendly conversation during the meals.  It's not easy to find a topic. Talking of home is painful. Talking of the present unbearable. One day, Peeta empties our breadbasket and points out how they have been careful to include types from the districts along with the refined bread of the Capitol. The fish-shaped loaf tinted green with seaweed from District 4. The crescent moon roll dotted with seeds from District 11. Somehow, although it's made from the same stuff, it looks a lot more appetizing than the ugly drop biscuits that are the standard fare at home.  ""And there you have it,"" says Peeta, scooping the breads back in the basket.  ""You certainly know a lot,"" I say.  ""Only about bread,"" he says. ""Okay, now laugh as if I've said something funny.""  We both give a somewhat convincing laugh and ignore the stares from around the room.  ""All right, I'll keep smiling pleasantly and you talk,"" says Peeta. It's wearing us both out, Haymitch's direction to be friendly. Because ever since I slammed my door, there's been a chill in the air between us. But we have our orders.  ""Did I ever tell you about the time I was chased by a bear?"" I ask.  ""No, but it sounds fascinating,"" says Peeta.  I try and animate my face as I recall the event, a true story, in which I'd foolishly challenged a black bear over the rights to a beehive. Peeta laughs and asks questions right on cue. He's much better at this than I am.  On the second day, while we're taking a shot at spear throwing, he whispers to me. ""I think we have a shadow.""  I throw my spear, which I'm not too bad at actually, if I don't have to throw too far, and see the little girl from District 11 standing back a bit, watching us. She's the twelve-year-old, the one who reminded me so of Prim in stature. Up close she looks about ten. She has bright, dark, eyes and satiny brown skin and stands tilted up on her toes with her arms slightly extended to her sides, as if ready to take wing at the slightest sound. It's impossible not to think of a bird.  I pick up another spear while Peeta throws. ""I think her name's Rue,"" he says softly.  I bite my lip. Rue is a small yellow flower that grows in the Meadow. Rue. Primrose. Neither of them could tip the scale at seventy pounds soaking wet.  ""What can we do about it?"" I ask him, more harshly than I intended.  ""Nothing to do,"" he says back. ""Just making conversation.""  Now that I know she's there, it's hard to ignore the child. She slips up and joins us at different stations. Like me, she's clever with plants, climbs swiftly, and has good aim. She can hit the target every time with a slingshot. But what is a slingshot against a 220-pound male with a sword?  Back on the District 12 floor, Haymitch and Effie grill us throughout breakfast and dinner about every moment of the day. What we did, who watched us, how the other tributes size up. Cinna and Portia aren't around, so there's no one to add any sanity to the meals. Not that Haymitch and Effie are fighting anymore. Instead they seem to be of one mind, determined to whip us into shape. Full of endless directions about what we should do and not do in training. Peeta is more patient, but I become fed up and surly.  When we finally escape to bed on the second night, Peeta mumbles, ""Someone ought to get Haymitch a drink.""  I make a sound that is somewhere between a snort and a laugh. Then catch myself. It's messing with my mind too much, trying to keep straight when we're supposedly friends and when we're not. At least when we get into the arena, I'll know where we stand. ""Don't. Don't let's pretend when there's no one around.""  ""All right, Katniss,"" he says tiredly. After that, we only talk in front of people.  On the third day of training, they start to call us out of lunch for our private sessions with the Gamemakers. District by district, first the boy, then the girl tribute. As usual, District 12 is slated to go last. We linger in the dining room, unsure where else to go. No one comes back once they have left. As the room empties, the pressure to appear friendly lightens. By the time they call Rue, we are left alone. We sit in silence until they summon Peeta. He rises.  ""Remember what Haymitch said about being sure to throw the weights."" The words come out of my mouth without permission.  ""Thanks. I will,"" he says. ""You. shoot straight.""  I nod. I don't know why I said anything at all. Although if I'm going to lose, I'd rather Peeta win than the others. Better for our district, for my mother and Prim.  After about fifteen minutes, they call my name. I smooth my hair, set my shoulders back, and walk into the gymnasium. Instantly, I know I'm in trouble. They've been here too long, the Gamemakers. Sat through twenty-three other demonstrations. Had too much to wine, most of them. Want more than anything to go home.  There's nothing I can do but continue with the plan. I walk to the archery station. Oh, the weapons! I've been itching to get my hands on them for days! Bows made of wood and plastic and metal and materials I can't even name. Arrows with feathers cut in flawless uniform lines. I choose a bow, string it, and sling the matching quiver of arrows over my shoulder. There's a shooting range, but it's much too limited. Standard bull's-eyes and human silhouettes. I walk to the center of the gymnasium and pick my first target. The dummy used for knife practice. Even as I pull back on the bow I know something is wrong. The string's tighter than the one I use at home. The arrow's more rigid. I miss the dummy by a couple of inches and lose what little attention I had been commanding. For a moment, I'm humiliated, then I head back to the bull's-eye. I shoot again and again until I get the feel of these new weapons.  Back in the center of the gymnasium, I take my initial position and skewer the dummy right through the heart. Then I sever the rope that holds the sandbag for boxing, and the bag splits open as it slams to the ground. Without pausing, I shoulder-roll forward, come up on one knee, and send an arrow into one of the hanging lights high above the gymnasium floor. A shower of sparks bursts from the fixture.  It's excellent shooting. I turn to the Gamemakers. A few are nodding approval, but the majority of them are fixated on a roast pig that has just arrived at their banquet table.  Suddenly I am furious, that with my life on the line, they don't even have the decency to pay attention to me. That I'm being upstaged by a dead pig. My heart starts to pound, I can feel my face burning. Without thinking, I pull an arrow from my quiver and send it straight at the Gamemakers' table. I hear shouts of alarm as people stumble back. The arrow skewers the apple in the pig's mouth and pins it to the wall behind it. Everyone stares at me in disbelief.  ""Thank you for your consideration,"" I say. Then I give a slight bow and walk straight toward the exit without being dismissed."
Hunger Games Chapter 8,"As I stride toward the elevator, I fling my bow to one side and my quiver to the other. I brush past the gaping Avoxes who guard the elevators and hit the number twelve button with my fist. The doors slide together and I zip upward. I actually make it back to my floor before the tears start running down my cheeks. I can hear the others calling me from the sitting room, but I fly down the hall into my room, bolt the door, and fling myself onto my bed. Then I really begin to sob.  Now I've done it! Now I've ruined everything! If I'd stood even a ghost of chance, it vanished when I sent that arrow flying at the Gamemakers. What will they do to me now? Arrest me? Execute me? Cut my tongue and turn me into an Avox so I can wait on the future tributes of Panem? What was I thinking, shooting at the Gamemakers? Of course, I wasn't, I was shooting at that apple because I was so angry at being ignored. I wasn't trying to kill one of them. If I were, they'd be dead!  Oh, what does it matter? It's not like I was going to win the Games anyway. Who cares what they do to me? What really scares me is what they might do to my mother and Prim, how my family might suffer now because of my impulsiveness. Will they take their few belongings, or send my mother to prison and Prim to the community home, or kill them? They wouldn't kill them, would they? Why not? What do they care?  I should have stayed and apologized. Or laughed, like it was a big joke. Then maybe I would have found some leniency. But instead I stalked out of the place in the most disrespectful manner possible.  Haymitch and Effie are knocking on my door. I shout for them to go away and eventually they do. It takes at least an hour for me to cry myself out. Then I just lay curled up on the bed, stroking the silken sheets, watching the sun set over the artificial candy Capitol.  At first, I expect guards to come for me. But as time passes, it seems less likely. I calm down. They still need a girl tribute from District 12, don't they? If the Gamemakers want to punish me, they can do it publicly. Wait until I'm in the arena and sic starving wild animals on me. You can bet they'll make sure I don't have a bow and arrow to defend myself.  Before that though, they'll give me a score so low, no one in their right mind would sponsor me. That's what will happen tonight. Since the training isn't open to viewers, the Gamemakers announce a score for each player. It gives the audience a starting place for the betting that will continue throughout the Games. The number, which is between one and twelve, one being irredeemably bad and twelve being unattainably high, signifies the promise of the tribute. The mark is not a guarantee of which person will win. It's only an indication of the potential a tribute showed in training. Often, because of the variables in the actual arena, high-scoring tributes go down almost immediately. And a few years ago, the boy who won the Games only received a three. Still, the scores can help or hurt an individual tribute in terms of sponsorship. I had been hoping my shooting skills might get me a six or a seven, even if I'm not particularly powerful. Now I'm sure I'll have the lowest score of the twenty-four. If no one sponsors me, my odds of staying alive decrease to almost zero.  When Effie taps on the door to call me to dinner, I decide I may as well go. The scores will be televised tonight. It's not like I can hide what happened forever. I go to the bathroom and wash my face, but it's still red and splotchy.  Everyone's waiting at the table, even Cinna and Portia. I wish the stylists hadn't shown up because for some reason, I don't like the idea of disappointing them. It's as if I've thrown away all the good work they did on the opening ceremonies without a thought. I avoid looking at anyone as I take tiny spoonfuls of fish soup. The saltiness reminds me of my tears.  The adults begin some chitchat about the weather forecast, and I let my eyes meet Peeta's. He raises his eyebrows. A question. What happened? I just give my head a small shake. Then, as they're serving the main course, I hear Haymitch say, ""Okay, enough small talk, just how bad were you today?""  Peeta jumps in. ""I don't know that it mattered. By the time I showed up, no one even bothered to look at me. They were singing some kind of drinking song, I think. So, I threw around some heavy objects until they told me I could go.""  That makes me feel a bit better. It's not like Peeta attacked the Gamemakers, but at least he was provoked, too.  ""And you, sweetheart?"" says Haymitch.  Somehow Haymitch calling me sweetheart ticks me off enough that I'm at least able to speak. ""I shot an arrow at the Gamemakers.""  Everyone stops eating. ""You what?"" The horror in Effie's voice confirms my worse suspicions.  ""I shot an arrow at them. Not exactly at them. In their direction. It's like Peeta said, I was shooting and they were ignoring me and I just. I just lost my head, so I shot an apple out of their stupid roast pig's mouth!"" I say defiantly.  ""And what did they say?"" says Cinna carefully.  ""Nothing. Or I don't know. I walked out after that,"" I say.  ""Without being dismissed?"" gasps Effie.  ""I dismissed myself,"" I said. I remember how I promised Prim that I really would try to win and I feel like a ton of coal has dropped on me.  ""Well, that's that,"" says Haymitch. Then he butters a roll.  ""Do you think they'll arrest me?"" I ask. ""Doubt it. Be a pain to replace you at this stage,"" says Haymitch.  ""What about my family?"" I say. ""Will they punish them?""  ""Don't think so. Wouldn't make much sense. See they'd have to reveal what happened in the Training Center for it to have any worthwhile effect on the population. People would need to know what you did. But they can't since it's secret, so it'd be a waste of effort,"" says Haymitch. ""More likely they'll make your life hell in the arena.""  ""Well, they've already promised to do that to us any way,"" says Peeta.  ""Very true,"" says Haymitch. And I realize the impossible has happened. They have actually cheered me up. Haymitch picks up a pork chop with his fingers, which makes Effie frown, and dunks it in his wine. He rips off a hunk of meat and starts to chuckle. ""What were their faces like?""  I can feel the edges of my mouth tilting up. ""Shocked. Terrified. Uh, ridiculous, some of them."" An image pops into my mind. ""One man tripped backward into a bowl of punch.""  Haymitch guffaws and we all start laughing except Effie, although even she is suppressing a smile. ""Well, it serves them right. It's their job to pay attention to you. And just because you come from District Twelve is no excuse to ignore you."" Then her eyes dart around as if she's said something totally outrageous. ""I'm sorry, but that's what I think,"" she says to no one in particular.  ""I'll get a very bad score,"" I say.  ""Scores only matter if they're very good, no one pays much attention to the bad or mediocre ones. For all they know, you could be hiding your talents to get a low score on purpose. People use that strategy,"" said Portia.  ""I hope that's how people interpret the four I'll probably get,"" says Peeta. ""If that. Really, is anything less impressive than watching a person pick up a heavy ball and throw it a couple of yards. One almost landed on my foot.""  I grin at him and realize that I'm starving. I cut off a piece of pork, dunk it in mashed potatoes, and start eating. It's okay. My family is safe. And if they are safe, no real harm has been done.  After dinner, we go to sitting room to watch the scores announced on television. First they show a photo of the tribute, then flash their score below it. The Career Tributes naturally get in the eight-to-ten range. Most of the other players average a five. Surprisingly, little Rue comes up with a seven. I don't know what she showed the judges, but she's so tiny it must have been impressive.  District 12 comes up last, as usual. Peeta pulls an eight so at least a couple of the Gamemakers must have been watching him. I dig my fingernails into my palms as my face comes up, expecting the worst. Then they're flashing the number eleven on the screen.  Eleven!  Effie Trinket lets out a squeal, and everybody is slapping me on the back and cheering and congratulating me. But it doesn't seem real.  ""There must be a mistake. How. how could that happen?"" I ask Haymitch.  ""Guess they liked your temper,"" he says. ""They've got a show to put on. They need some players with some heat.""  ""Katniss, the girl who was on fire,"" says Cinna and gives me a hug. ""Oh, wait until you see your interview dress."" ""More flames?"" I ask. ""Of a sort,"" he says mischievously.  Peeta and I congratulate each other, another awkward moment. We've both done well, but what does that mean for the other? I escape to my room as quickly as possible and burrow down under the covers. The stress of the day, particularly the crying, has worn me out. I drift off, reprieved, relieved, and with the number eleven still flashing behind my eyelids.  At dawn, I lie in bed for a while, watching the sun come up on a beautiful morning. It's Sunday. A day off at home. I wonder if Gale is in the woods yet. Usually we devote all of Sunday to stocking up for the week. Rising early, hunting and gathering, then trading at the Hob. I think of Gale without me. Both of us can hunt alone, but we're better as a pair. Particularly if we're trying for bigger game. But also in the littler things, having a partner lightened the load, could even make the arduous task of filling my family's table enjoyable.  I had been struggling along on my own for about six months when I first ran into Gale in the woods. It was a Sunday in October, the air cool and pungent with dying things. I'd spent the morning competing with the squirrels for nuts and the slightly warmer afternoon wading in shallow ponds harvesting Katniss. The only meat I'd shot was a squirrel that had practically run over my toes in its quest for acorns, but the animals would still be afoot when the snow buried my other food sources. Having strayed farther afield than usual, I was hurrying back home, lugging my burlap sacks when I came across a dead rabbit. It was hanging by its neck in a thin wire a foot above my head. About fifteen yards away was another. I recognized the twitch-up snares because my father had used them. When the prey is caught, it's yanked into the air out of the reach of other hungry animals. I'd been trying to use snares all summer with no success, so I couldn't help dropping my sacks to examine this one. My fingers were just on the wire above one of the rabbits when a voice rang out. ""That's dangerous.""  I jumped back several feet as Gale materialized from behind a tree. He must have been watching me the whole time. He was only fourteen, but he cleared six feet and was as good as an adult to me. I'd seen him around the Seam and at school. And one other time. He'd lost his father in the same blast that killed mine. In January, I'd stood by while he received his medal of valor in the Justice Building, another oldest child with no father. I remembered his two little brothers clutching his mother, a woman whose swollen belly announced she was just days away from giving birth.  ""What's your name?"" he said, coming over and disengaging the rabbit from the snare. He had another three hanging from his belt.  ""Katniss,"" I said, barely audible.  ""Well, Catnip, stealing's punishable by death, or hadn't you heard?"" he said.  ""Katniss,"" I said louder. ""And I wasn't stealing it. I just wanted to look at your snare. Mine never catch anything.""  He scowled at me, not convinced. ""So where'd you get the squirrel?""  ""I shot it."" I pulled my bow off my shoulder. I was still using the small version my father had made me, but I'd been practicing with the full-size one when I could. I was hoping that by spring I might be able to bring down some bigger game.  Gale's eyes fastened on the bow. ""Can I see that?"" I handed it over. ""Just remember, stealing's punishable by death.""  That was the first time I ever saw him smile. It transformed him from someone menacing to someone you wished you knew. But it took several months before I returned that smile.  We talked hunting then. I told him I might be able to get him a bow if he had something to trade. Not food. I wanted knowledge. I wanted to set my own snares that caught a belt of fat rabbits in one day. He agreed something might be worked out. As the seasons went by, we grudgingly began to share our knowledge, our weapons, our secret places that were thick with wild plums or turkeys. He taught me snares and fishing. I showed him what plants to eat and eventually gave him one of our precious bows. And then one day, without either of us saying it, we became a team. Dividing the work and the spoils. Making sure that both our families had food.  Gale gave me a sense of security I'd lacked since my father's death. His companionship replaced the long solitary hours in the woods. I became a much better hunter when I didn't have to look over my shoulder constantly, when someone was watching my back. But he turned into so much more than a hunting partner. He became my confidante, someone with whom I could share thoughts I could never voice inside the fence. In exchange, he trusted me with his. Being out in the woods with Gale. sometimes I was actually happy.  I call him my friend, but in the last year it's seemed too casual a word for what Gale is to me. A pang of longing shoots through my chest. If only he was with me now! But, of course, I don't want that. I don't want him in the arena where he'd be dead in a few days. I just. I just miss him. And I hate being so alone. Does he miss me? He must.  I think of the eleven flashing under my name last night. I know exactly what he'd say to me. ""Well, there's some room for improvement there."" And then he'd give me a smile and I'd return it without hesitating now.  I can't help comparing what I have with Gale to what I'm pretending to have with Peeta. How I never question Gale's motives while I do nothing but doubt the latter's. It's not a fair comparison really. Gale and I were thrown together by a mutual need to survive. Peeta and I know the other's survival means our own death. How do you sidestep that?  Effie's knocking at the door, reminding me there's another ""big, big, big day!"" ahead. Tomorrow night will be our televised interviews. I guess the whole team will have their hands full readying us for that.  I get up and take a quick shower, being a bit more careful about the buttons I hit, and head down to the dining room. Peeta, Effie, and Haymitch are huddled around the table talking in hushed voices. That seems odd, but hunger wins out over curiosity and I load up my plate with breakfast before I join them.  The stew's made with tender chunks of lamb and dried plums today. Perfect on the bed of wild rice. I've shoveled about halfway through the mound when I realize no one's talking. I take a big gulp of orange juice and wipe my mouth. ""So, what's going on? You're coaching us on interviews today, right?""  ""That's right,"" says Haymitch.  ""You don't have to wait until I'm done. I can listen and cat at the same time,"" I say.  ""Well, there's been a change of plans. About our current approach,"" says Haymitch.  ""What's that?"" I ask. I'm not sure what our current approach is. Trying to appear mediocre in front of the other tributes is the last bit of strategy I remember.  Haymitch shrugs. ""Peeta has asked to be coached separately."""
Hunger Games Chapter 9,"Betrayal. That's the first thing I feel, which is ludicrous. For there to be betrayal, there would have had to been trust first. Between Peeta and me. And trust has not been part of the agreement. We're tributes. But the boy who risked a beating to give me bread, the one who steadied me in the chariot, who covered for me with the redheaded Avox girl, who insisted Haymitch know my hunting skills. was there some part of me that couldn't help trusting him?  On the other hand, I'm relieved that we can stop the pretense of being friends. Obviously, whatever thin connection we'd foolishly formed has been severed. And high time, too. The Games begin in two days, and trust will only be a weakness. Whatever triggered Peeta's decision  -  and I suspect it had to do with my outperforming him in training  -  I should be nothing but grateful for it. Maybe he's finally accepted the fact that the sooner we openly acknowledge that we are enemies, the better.  ""Good,"" I say. ""So what's the schedule?""  ""You'll each have four hours with Effie for presentation and four with me for content,"" says Haymitch. ""You start with Effie, Katniss.""  I can't imagine what Effie will have to teach me that could take four hours, but she's got me working down to the last minute. We go to my rooms and she puts me in a full-length gown and high-heeled shoes, not the ones I'll he wearing for the actual interview, and instructs me on walking. The shoes are the worst part. I've never worn high heels and can't get used to essentially wobbling around on the balls of my feet. But Effie runs around in them full-time, and I'm determined that if she can do it, so can I. The dress poses another problem. It keeps tangling around my shoes so, of course, I hitch it up, and then Effie swoops down on me like a hawk, smacking my hands and yelling, ""Not above the ankle!"" When I finally conquer walking, there's still sitting, posture  -  apparently I have a tendency to duck my head  -  eye contact, hand gestures, and smiling. Smiling is mostly about smiling more. Effie makes me say a hundred banal phrases starting with a smile, while smiling, or ending with a smile. By lunch, the muscles in my cheeks are twitching from overuse.  ""Well, that's the best I can do,"" Effie says with a sigh. ""Just remember, Katniss, you want the audience to like you.""  ""And you don't think they will?"" I ask.  ""Not if you glare at them the entire time. Why don't you save that for the arena? Instead, think of yourself among friends,"" says Effie.  ""They're betting on how long I'll live!"" I burst out. ""They're not my friends!""  ""Well, try and pretend!"" snaps Effie. Then she composes herself and beams at me. ""See, like this. I'm smiling at you even though you're aggravating me.""  ""Yes, it feels very convincing,"" I say. ""I'm going to eat."" 1 kick off my heels and stomp down to the dining room, hiking my skirt up to my thighs.  Peeta and Haymitch seem in pretty good moods, so I'm thinking the content session should be an improvement over the morning. I couldn't be more wrong. After lunch, Haymitch takes me into the sitting room, directs me to the couch, and then just frowns at me for a while.  ""What?"" I finally ask.  ""I'm trying to figure out what to do with you,"" he says. ""How we're going to present you. Are you going to be charming? Aloof? Fierce? So far, you're shining like a star. You volunteered to save your sister. Cinna made you look unforgettable. You've got the top training score. People are intrigued, but no one knows who you are. The impression you make tomorrow will decide exactly what I can get you in terms of sponsors,"" says Haymitch.  Having watched the tribute interviews all my life, I know there's truth to what he's saying. If you appeal to the crowd, either by being humorous or brutal or eccentric, you gain favor.  ""What's Peeta's approach? Or am I not allowed to ask?"" I say.  ""Likable. He has a sort of self-deprecating humor naturally,"" says Haymitch. ""Whereas when you open your mouth, you come across more as sullen and hostile.""  ""I do not!"" I say.  ""Please. I don't know where you pulled that cheery, wavy girl on the chariot from, but I haven't seen her before or since,"" says Haymitch.  ""And you've given me so many reasons to be cheery,"" I counter.  ""But you don't have to please me. I'm not going to sponsor you. So pretend I'm the audience,"" says Haymitch. ""Delight me.""  ""Fine!"" I snarl. Haymitch takes the role of the interviewer and I try to answer his questions in a winning fashion. But I can't. I'm too angry with Haymitch for what he said and that I even have to answer the questions. All I can think is how unjust the whole thing is, the Hunger Games. Why am I hopping around like some trained dog trying to please people I hate? The longer the interview goes on, the more my fury seems to rise to the surface, until I'm literally spitting out answers at him.  ""All right, enough,"" he says. ""We've got to find another angle. Not only are you hostile, I don't know anything about you. I've asked you fifty questions and still have no sense of your life, your family, what you care about. They want to know about you, Katniss.""  ""But I don't want them to! They're already taking my future! They can't have the things that mattered to me in the past!"" I say.  ""Then lie! Make something up!"" says Haymitch.  ""I'm not good at lying,"" I say.  ""Well, you better learn fast. You've got about as much charm as a dead slug,"" says Haymitch.  Ouch. That hurts. Even Haymitch must know he's been too harsh because his voice softens. ""Here's an idea. Try acting humble.""  ""Humble,"" I echo.  ""That you can't believe a little girl from District Twelve has done this well. The whole thing's been more than you ever could have dreamed of. Talk about Cinna's clothes. How nice the people are. How the city amazes you. If you won't talk about yourself, at least compliment the audience. Just keep turning it back around, all right. Gush.""  The next hours are agonizing. At once, it's clear I cannot gush. We try me playing cocky, but I just don't have the arrogance. Apparently, I'm too ""vulnerable"" for ferocity. I'm not witty. Funny. Sexy. Or mysterious.  By the end of the session, I am no one at all. Haymitch started drinking somewhere around witty, and a nasty edge has crept into his voice. ""I give up, sweetheart. Just answer the questions and try not to let the audience see how openly you despise them.""  I have dinner that night in my room, ordering an outrageous number of delicacies, eating myself sick, and then taking out my anger at Haymitch, at the Hunger Games, at every living being in the Capitol by smashing dishes around my room. When the girl with the red hair comes in to turn down my bed, her eyes widen at the mess. ""Just leave it!"" I yell at her. ""Just leave it alone!""  I hate her, too, with her knowing reproachful eyes that call me a coward, a monster, a puppet of the Capitol, both now and then. For her, justice must finally be happening. At least my death will help pay for the life of the boy in the woods.  But instead of fleeing the room, the girl closes the door behind her and goes to the bathroom. She comes back with a damp cloth and wipes my face gently then cleans the blood from a broken plate off my hands. Why is she doing this? Why am I letting her?  ""I should have tried to save you,"" I whisper.  She shakes her head. Does this mean we were right to stand by? That she has forgiven me?  ""No, it was wrong,"" I say.  She taps her lips with her fingers then points to my chest. I think she means that I would just have ended up an Avox, too. Probably would have. An Avox or dead.  I spend the next hour helping the redheaded girl clean the room. When all the garbage has been dropped down a disposal and the food cleaned away, she turns down my bed. I crawl in between the sheets like a five-year-old and let her tuck me in. Then she goes. I want her to stay until I fall asleep. To be there when I wake up. I want the protection of this girl, even though she never had mine.  In the morning, it's not the girl but my prep team who are hanging over me. My lessons with Effie and Haymitch are over. This day belongs to Cinna. He's my last hope. Maybe he can make me look so wonderful, no one will care what comes out of my mouth.  The team works on me until late afternoon, turning my skin to glowing satin, stenciling patterns on my arms, painting flame designs on my twenty perfect nails. Then Venia goes to work on my hair, weaving strands of red into a pattern that begins at my left ear, wraps around my head, and then falls in one braid down my right shoulder. They erase my face with a layer of pale makeup and draw my features back out. Huge dark eyes, full red lips, lashes that throw off bits of light when I blink. Finally, they cover my entire body in a powder that makes me shimmer in gold dust.  Then Cinna enters with what I assume is my dress, but I can't really see it because it's covered. ""Close your eyes,"" he orders.  I can feel the silken inside as they slip it down over my naked body, then the weight. It must be forty pounds. I clutch Octavia's hand as I blindly step into my shoes, glad to find they are at least two inches lower than the pair Effie had me practice in. There's some adjusting and fidgeting. Then silence.  ""Can I open my eyes?"" I ask.  ""Yes,"" says Cinna. ""Open them.""  The creature standing before me in the full-length mirror has come from another world. Where skin shimmers and eyes flash and apparently they make their clothes from jewels. Because my dress, oh, my dress is entirely covered in reflective precious gems, red and yellow and white with bits of blue that accent the tips of the flame design. The slightest movement gives the impression I am engulfed in tongues of fire.  I am not pretty. I am not beautiful. I am as radiant as the sun.  For a while, we all just stare at me. ""Oh, Cinna,"" I finally whisper. ""Thank you.""  ""Twirl for me,"" he says. I hold out my arms and spin in a circle. The prep team screams in admiration.  Cinna dismisses the team and has me move around in the dress and shoes, which are infinitely more manageable than Effie's. The dress hangs in such a way that I don't have to lift the skirt when I walk, leaving me with one less thing to worry about.  ""So, all ready for the interview then?"" asks Cinna. I can see by his expression that he's been talking to Haymitch. That he knows how dreadful I am.  ""I'm awful. Haymitch called me a dead slug. No matter what we tried, I couldn't do it. I just can't be one of those people he wants me to be,"" I say.  Cinna thinks about this a moment. ""Why don't you just be yourself?""  ""Myself? That's no good, either. Haymitch says I'm sullen and hostile,"" I say.  ""Well, you are. around Haymitch,"" says Cinna with a grin. ""I don't find you so. The prep team adores you. You even won over the Gamemakers. And as for the citizens of the Capitol, well, they can't stop talking about you. No one can help but admire your spirit.""  My spirit. This is a new thought. I'm not sure exactly what it means, but it suggests I'm a fighter. In a sort of brave way. It's not as if I'm never friendly. Okay, maybe I don't go around loving everybody I meet, maybe my smiles are hard to come by, but I do care for some people.  Cinna takes my icy hands in his warm ones. ""Suppose, when you answer the questions, you think you're addressing a friend back home. Who would your best friend be?"" asks Cinna.  ""Gale,"" I say instantly. ""Only it doesn't make sense, Cinna. I would never be telling Gale those things about me. He already knows them.""  ""What about me? Could you think of me as a friend?"" asks Cinna.  Of all the people I've met since I left home, Cinna is by far my favorite. I liked him right off and he hasn't disappointed me yet. ""I think so, but  - ""  ""I'll be sitting on the main platform with the other stylists. You'll be able to look right at me. When you're asked a question, find me, and answer it as honestly as possible,"" says Cinna.  ""Even if what I think is horrible?"" I ask. Because it might be, really.  ""Especially if what you think is horrible,"" says Cinna. ""You'll try it?""  I nod. It's a plan. Or at least a straw to grasp at.  Too soon it's time to go. The interviews take place on a stage constructed in front of the Training Center. Once I leave my room, it will be only minutes until I'm in front of the crowd, the cameras, all of Panem.  As Cinna turns the doorknob, I stop his hand. ""Cinna. "" I'm completely overcome with stage fright.  ""Remember, they already love you,"" he says gently. ""Just be yourself.""  We meet up with the rest of the District 12 crowd at the elevator. Portia and her gang have been hard at work. Peeta looks striking in a black suit with flame accents. While we look well together, it's a relief not to be dressed identically. Haymitch and Effie are all fancied up for the occasion. I avoid Haymitch, but accept Effie's compliments. Effie can be tiresome and clueless, but she's not destructive like Haymitch.  When the elevator opens, the other tributes are being lined up to take the stage. All twenty-four of us sit in a big arc throughout the interviews. I'll be last, or second to last since the girl tribute precedes the boy from each district. How I wish I could be first and get the whole thing out of the way! Now I'll have to listen to how witty, funny, humble, fierce, and charming everybody else is before I go up. Plus, the audience will start to get bored, just as the Gamemakers did. And I can't exactly shoot an arrow into the crowd to get their attention.  Right before we parade onto the stage, Haymitch comes up behind Peeta and me and growls, ""Remember, you're still a happy pair. So act like it.""  What? I thought we abandoned that when Peeta asked for separate coaching. But I guess that was a private, not a public thing. Anyway, there's not much chance for interaction now, as we walk single-file to our seats and take our places.  Just stepping on the stage makes my breathing rapid and shallow. I can feel my pulse pounding in my temples. It's a relief to get to my chair, because between the heels and my legs shaking, I'm afraid I'll trip. Although evening is falling, the City Circle is brighter than a summer's day. An elevated seating unit has been set up for prestigious guests, with the stylists commanding the front row. The cameras will turn to them when the crowd is reacting to their handiwork. A large balcony off a building to the right has been reserved for the Gamemakers. Television crews have claimed most of the other balconies. But the City Circle and the avenues that feed into it are completely packed with people. Standing room only. At homes and community halls around the country, every television set is turned on. Every citizen of Panem is tuned in. There will be no blackouts tonight.  Caesar Flickerman, the man who has hosted the interviews for more than forty years, bounces onto the stage. It's a little scary because his appearance has been virtually unchanged during all that time. Same face under a coating of pure white makeup. Same hairstyle that he dyes a different color for each Hunger Games. Same ceremonial suit, midnight blue dotted with a thousand tiny electric bulbs that twinkle like stars. They do surgery in the Capitol, to make people appear younger and thinner. In District 12, looking old is something of an achievement since so many people die early. You see an elderly person you want to congratulate them on their longevity, ask the secret of survival. A plump person is envied because they aren't scraping by like the majority of us. But here it is different. Wrinkles aren't desirable. A round belly isn't a sign of success.  This year, Caesar's hair is powder blue and his eyelids and lips are coated in the same hue. He looks freakish but less frightening than he did last year when his color was crimson and he seemed to be bleeding. Caesar tells a few jokes to warm up the audience but then gets down to business.  The girl tribute from District 1, looking provocative in a see-through gold gown, steps up the center of the stage to join Caesar for her interview. You can tell her mentor didn't have any trouble coming up with an angle for her. With that flowing blonde hair, emerald green eyes, her body tall and lush. she's sexy all the way.  Each interview only lasts three minutes. Then a buzzer goes off and the next tribute is up. I'll say this for Caesar, he really does his best to make the tributes shine. He's friendly, tries to set the nervous ones at ease, laughs at lame jokes, and can turn a weak response into a memorable one by the way he reacts.  I sit like a lady, the way Effie showed me, as the districts slip by. 2, 3, 4. Everyone seems to be playing up some angle. The monstrous boy from District 2 is a ruthless killing machine. The fox-faced girl from District 5 sly and elusive. I spotted Cinna as soon as he took his place, but even his presence cannot relax me. 8, 9, 10. The crippled boy from 10 is very quiet. My palms are sweating like crazy, but the jeweled dress isn't absorbent and they skid right of if I try to dry them. 11.  Rue, who is dressed in a gossamer gown complete with wings, flutters her way to Caesar. A hush falls over the crowd at the sight of this magical wisp of a tribute. Caesar's very sweet with her, complimenting her seven in training, an excellent score for one so small. When he asks her what her greatest strength in the arena will be, she doesn't hesitate. ""I'm very hard to catch,"" she says in a tremulous voice. ""And if they can't catch me, they can't kill me. So don't count me out.""  ""I wouldn't in a million years,"" says Caesar encouragingly.  The boy tribute from District 11, Thresh, has the same dark skin as Rue, but the resemblance stops there. He's one of the giants, probably six and a half feet tall and built like an ox, but I noticed he rejected the invitations from the Career Tributes to join their crowd. Instead he's been very solitary, speaking to no one, showing little interest in training. Even so, he scored a ten and it's not hard to imagine he impressed the Gamemakers. He ignores Caesar's attempts at banter and answers with a yes or no or just remains silent.  If only I was his size, I could get away with sullen and hostile and it would be just fine! I bet half the sponsors are at least considering him. If I had any money, I'd bet on him myself.  And then they're calling Katniss Everdeen, and I feel myself, as if in a dream, standing and making my way center stage. I shake Caesar's outstretched hand, and he has the good grace not to immediately wipe his off on his suit.  ""So, Katniss, the Capitol must be quite a change from District Twelve. What's impressed you most since you arrived here?"" asks Caesar.  What? What did he say? It's as if the words make no sense.  My mouth has gone as dry as sawdust. I desperately find Cinna in the crowd and lock eyes with him. I imagine the words coming from his lips. ""What's impressed you most since you arrived here?"" I rack my brain for something that made me happy here. Be honest, I think. Be honest.  ""The lamb stew,"" I get out.  Caesar laughs, and vaguely I realize some of the audience has joined in.  ""The one with the dried plums?"" asks Caesar. I nod. ""Oh, I eat it by the bucketful."" He turns sideways to the audience in horror, hand on his stomach. ""It doesn't show, does it?"" They shout reassurances to him and applaud. This is what I mean about Caesar. He tries to help you out.  ""Now, Katniss,"" he says confidentially, ""When you came out in the opening ceremonies, my heart actually stopped. What did you think of that costume?""  Cinna raises one eyebrow at me. Be honest. ""You mean after I got over my fear of being burned alive?"" I ask.  Big laugh. A real one from the audience.  ""Yes. Start then,"" says Caesar.  Cinna, my friend, I should tell him anyway. ""I thought Cinna was brilliant and it was the most gorgeous costume I'd ever seen and I couldn't believe I was wearing it. I can't believe I'm wearing this, either."" I lift up my skirt to spread it out. ""I mean, look at it!""  As the audience oohs and ahs, I see Cinna make the tiniest circular motion with his finger. But I know what he's saying. Twirl for me.  I spin in a circle once and the reaction is immediate.  ""Oh, do that again!"" says Caesar, and so I lift up my arms and spin around and around letting the skirt fly out, letting the dress engulf me in flames. The audience breaks into cheers. When I stop, I clutch Caesar's arm.  ""Don't stop!"" he says.  ""I have to, I'm dizzy!"" I'm also giggling, which I think I've done maybe never in my lifetime. But the nerves and the spinning have gotten to me.  Caesar wraps a protective arm around me. ""Don't worry, I've got you. Can't have you following in your mentor's footsteps.""  Everyone's hooting as the cameras find Haymitch, who is by now famous for his head dive at the reaping, and he waves them away good-naturedly and points back to me.  ""It's all right,"" Caesar reassures the crowd. ""She's safe with me. So, how about that training score. E-le-ven. Give us a hint what happened in there.""  I glance at the Gamemakers on the balcony and bite my lip. ""Um. all I can say, is I think it was a first.""  The cameras are right on the Gamemakers, who are chuckling and nodding.  ""You're killing us,"" says Caesar as if in actual pain. ""Details. Details.""  I address the balcony. ""I'm not supposed to talk about it, right?""  The Gamemaker who fell in the punch bowl shouts out, ""She's not!""  ""Thank you,"" I say. ""Sorry. My lips are sealed.""  ""Let's go back then, to the moment they called your sister's name at the reaping,"" says Caesar. His mood is quieter now. ""And you volunteered. Can you tell us about her?""  No. No, not all of you. But maybe Cinna. I don't think I'm imagining the sadness on his face. ""Her name's Prim. She's just twelve. And I love her more than anything.""  You could hear a pin drop in the City Circle now.  ""What did she say to you? After the reaping?"" Caesar asks.  Be honest. Be honest. I swallow hard. ""She asked me to try really hard to win."" The audience is frozen, hanging on my every word.  ""And what did you say?"" prompts Caesar gently.  But instead of warmth, I feel an icy rigidity take over my body. My muscles tense as they do before a kill. When I speak, my voice seems to have dropped an octave. ""I swore I would.""  ""I bet you did,"" says Caesar, giving me a squeeze. The buzzer goes off. ""Sorry we're out of time. Best of luck, Katniss Everdeen, tribute from District Twelve.""  The applause continues long after I'm seated. I look to Cinna for reassurance. He gives me a subtle thumbs-up.  I'm still in a daze for the first part of Peeta's interview. He has the audience from the get-go, though; I can hear them laughing, shouting out. He plays up the baker's son thing, comparing the tributes to the breads from their districts. Then has a funny anecdote about the perils of the Capitol showers. ""Tell me, do I still smell like roses?"" he asks Caesar, and then there's a whole run where they take turns sniffing each other that brings down the house. I'm coming back into focus when Caesar asks him if he has a girlfriend back home.  Peeta hesitates, then gives an unconvincing shake of his head.  ""Handsome lad like you. There must be some special girl. Come on, what's her name?"" says Caesar.  Peeta sighs. ""Well, there is this one girl. I've had a crush on her ever since I can remember. But I'm pretty sure she didn't know I was alive until the reaping.""  Sounds of sympathy from the crowd. Unrequited love they can relate to.  ""She have another fellow?"" asks Caesar.  ""I don't know, but a lot of boys like her,"" says Peeta.  ""So, here's what you do. You win, you go home. She can't turn you down then, eh?"" says Caesar encouragingly.  ""I don't think it's going to work out. Winning. won't help in my case,"" says Peeta.  ""Why ever not?"" says Caesar, mystified.  Peeta blushes beet red and stammers out. ""Because. because. she came here with me."""
Hunger Games Chapter 10,"For a moment, the cameras hold on Peeta's downcast eyes as what he says sinks in. Then I can see my face, mouth half open in a mix of surprise and protest, magnified on every screen as I realize, Me! He means me! I press my lips together and stare at the floor, hoping this will conceal the emotions starting to boil up inside of me.  ""Oh, that is a piece of bad luck,"" says Caesar, and there's a real edge of pain in his voice. The crowd is murmuring in agreement, a few have even given agonized cries.  ""It's not good,"" agrees Peeta.  ""Well, I don't think any of us can blame you. It'd be hard not to fall for that young lady,"" says Caesar. ""She didn't know?""  Peeta shakes his head. ""Not until now.""  I allow my eyes to flicker up to the screen long enough to see that the blush on my cheeks is unmistakable.  ""Wouldn't you love to pull her back out here and get a response?"" Caesar asks the audience. The crowd screams assent. ""Sadly, rules are rules, and Katniss Everdeen's time has been spent. Well, best of luck to you, Peeta Mellark, and I think I speak for all of Panem when I say our hearts go with yours.""  The roar of the crowd is deafening. Peeta has absolutely wiped the rest of us off the map with his declaration of love for me. When the audience finally settles down, he chokes out a quiet ""Thank you"" and returns to his seat. We stand for the anthem. I have to raise my head out of the required respect and cannot avoid seeing that every screen is now dominated by a shot of Peeta and me, separated by a few feet that in the viewers' heads can never be breached. Poor tragic us.  But I know better.  After the anthem, the tributes file back into the Training Center lobby and onto the elevators. I make sure to veer into a car that does not contain Peeta. The crowd slows our entourages of stylists and mentors and chaperones, so we have only each other for company. No one speaks. My elevator stops to deposit four tributes before I am alone and then find the doors opening on the twelfth floor. Peeta has only just stepped from his car when I slam my palms into his chest. He loses his balance and crashes into an ugly urn filled with fake flowers. The urn tips and shatters into hundreds of tiny pieces. Peeta lands in the shards, and blood immediately flows from his hands.  ""What was that for?"" he says, aghast.  ""You had no right! No right to go saying those things about me!"" I shout at him.  Now the elevators open and the whole crew is there, Effie, Haymitch, Cinna, and Portia.  ""What's going on?"" says Effie, a note of hysteria in her voice. ""Did you fall?""  ""After she shoved me,"" says Peeta as Effie and Cinna help him up.  Haymitch turns on me. ""Shoved him?""  ""This was your idea, wasn't it? Turning me into some kind of fool in front of the entire country?"" I answer.  ""It was my idea,"" says Peeta, wincing as he pulls spikes of pottery from his palms. ""Haymitch just helped me with it.""  ""Yes, Haymitch is very helpful. To you!"" I say.  ""You are a fool,"" Haymitch says in disgust. ""Do you think he hurt you? That boy just gave you something you could never achieve on your own.""  ""He made me look weak!"" I say.  ""He made you look desirable! And let's face it, you can use all the help you can get in that department. You were about as romantic as dirt until he said he wanted you. Now they all do. You're all they're talking about. The star-crossed lovers from District Twelve!"" says Haymitch.  ""But we're not star-crossed lovers!"" I say.  Haymitch grabs my shoulders and pins me against the wall. ""Who cares? It's all a big show. It's all how you're perceived. The most I could say about you after your interview was that you were nice enough, although that in itself was a small miracle. Now I can say you're a heartbreaker. Oh, oh, oh, how the boys back home fall longingly at your feet. Which do you think will get you more sponsors?""  The smell of wine on his breath makes me sick. I shove his hands off my shoulders and step away, trying to clear my head.  Cinna comes over and puts his arm around me. ""He's right, Katniss.""  I don't know what to think. ""I should have been told, so I didn't look so stupid.""  ""No, your reaction was perfect. If you'd known, it wouldn't have read as real,"" says Portia.  ""She's just worried about her boyfriend,"" says Peeta gruffly, tossing away a bloody piece of the urn.  My cheeks burn again at the thought of Gale. ""I don't have a boyfriend.""  ""Whatever,"" says Peeta. ""But I bet he's smart enough to know a bluff when he sees it. Besides you didn't say you loved me. So what does it matter?""  The words are sinking in. My anger fading. I'm torn now between thinking I've been used and thinking I've been given an edge. Haymitch is right. I survived my interview, but what was I really? A silly girl spinning in a sparkling, dress. Giggling. The only moment of any substance I hail was when I talked about Prim. Compare that with Thresh, his silent, deadly power, and I'm forgettable. Silly and sparkly and forgettable. No, not entirely forgettable, I have my eleven in training.  But now Peeta has made me an object of love. Not just his. To hear him tell it I have many admirers. And if the audience really thinks we're in love. I remember how strongly they responded to his confession. Star-crossed lovers. Haymitch is right, they eat that stuff up in the Capitol. Suddenly I'm worried that I didn't react properly.  ""After he said he loved me, did you think I could be in love with him, too?"" I ask.  ""I did,"" says Portia. ""The way you avoided looking at the cameras, the blush.""  They others chime in, agreeing.  ""You're golden, sweetheart. You're going to have sponsors lined up around the block,"" says Haymitch.  I'm embarrassed about my reaction. I force myself to acknowledge Peeta. ""I'm sorry I shoved you.""  ""Doesn't matter,"" he shrugs. ""Although it's technically illegal.""  ""Are your hands okay?"" I ask. ""They'll be all right,"" he says.  In the silence that follows, delicious smells of our dinner waft in from the dining room. ""Come on, let's eat,"" says Haymitch. We all follow him to the table and take our places. But then Peeta is bleeding too heavily, and Portia leads him off for medical treatment. We start the cream and rose-petal soup without them. By the time we've finished, they're back. Peeta's hands are wrapped in bandages. I can't help feeling guilty. Tomorrow we will be in the arena. He has done me a favor and I have answered with an injury. Will I never stop owing him?  After dinner, we watch the replay in the sitting room. I seem frilly and shallow, twirling and giggling in my dress, although the others assure me I am charming. Peeta actually is charming and then utterly winning as the boy in love. And there I am, blushing and confused, made beautiful by Cinna's hands, desirable by Peeta's confession, tragic by circumstance, and by all accounts, unforgettable.  When the anthem finishes and the screen goes dark, a hush falls on the room. Tomorrow at dawn, we will be roused and prepared for the arena. The actual Games don't start until ten because so many of the Capitol residents rise late. But Peeta and I must make an early start. There is no telling how far we will travel to the arena that has been prepared for this year's Games.  I know Haymitch and Effie will not be going with us. As soon as they leave here, they'll be at the Games Headquarters, hopefully madly signing up our sponsors, working out a strategy on how and when to deliver the gifts to us. Cinna and Portia will travel with us to the very spot from which we will be launched into the arena. Still final good-byes must be said here.  Effie takes both of us by the hand and, with actual tears in her eyes, wishes us well. Thanks us for being the best tributes it has ever been her privilege to sponsor. And then, because it's Effie and she's apparently required by law to say something awful, she adds ""I wouldn't be at all surprised if I finally get promoted to a decent district next year!""  Then she kisses us each on the cheek and hurries out, overcome with either the emotional parting or the possible improvement of her fortunes.  Haymitch crosses his arms and looks us both over.  ""Any final words of advice?"" asks Peeta.  ""When the gong sounds, get the hell out of there. You're neither of you up to the blood bath at the Cornucopia. Just clear out, put as much distance as you can between yourselves and the others, and find a source of water,"" he says. ""Got it?""  ""And after that?"" I ask.  ""Stay alive,"" says Haymitch. It's the same advice he gave us on the train, but he's not drunk and laughing this time. And we only nod. What else is there to say?  When I head to my room, Peeta lingers to talk to Portia. I'm glad. Whatever strange words of parting we exchange can wait until tomorrow. My covers are drawn back, but there is no sign of the redheaded Avox girl. I wish I knew her name. I should have asked it. She could write it down maybe. Or act it out. But perhaps that would only result in punishment for her.  I take a shower and scrub the gold paint, the makeup, the scent of beauty from my body. All that remains of the design-team's efforts are the flames on my nails. I decide to keep them as reminder of who I am to the audience. Katniss, the girl who was on fire. Perhaps it will give me something to hold on to in the days to come.  I pull on a thick, fleecy nightgown and climb into bed. It takes me about five seconds to realize I'll never fall asleep. And I need sleep desperately because in the arena every moment I give in to fatigue will be an invitation to death.  It's no good. One hour, two, three pass, and my eyelids refuse to get heavy. I can't stop trying to imagine exactly what terrain I'll be thrown into. Desert? Swamp? A frigid wasteland? Above all I am hoping for trees, which may afford me some means of concealment and food and shelter, Often there are trees because barren landscapes are dull and the Games resolve too quickly without them. But what will the climate be like? What traps have the Gamemakers hid den to liven up the slower moments? And then there are my fellow tributes.  The more anxious I am to find sleep, the more it eludes me. Finally, I am too restless to even stay in bed. I pace the floor, heart beating too fast, breathing too short. My room feels like a prison cell. If I don't get air soon, I'm going to start to throw things again. I run down the hall to the door to the roof. It's not only unlocked but ajar. Perhaps someone forgot to close it, but it doesn't matter. The energy field enclosing the roof prevents any desperate form of escape. And I'm not looking to escape, only to fill my lungs with air. I want to see the sky and the moon on the last night that no one will be hunting me.  The roof is not lit at night, but as soon as my bare feel reach its tiled surface I see his silhouette, black against the lights that shine endlessly in the Capitol. There's quite a commotion going on down in the streets, music and singing and car horns, none of which I could hear through the thick glass window panels in my room. I could slip away now, without him noticing me; he wouldn't hear me over the din, But the night air's so sweet, I can't bear returning to that stuffy cage of a room. And what difference does it make? Whether we speak or not?  My feet move soundlessly across the tiles. I'm only yard behind him when I say, ""You should be getting some sleep.""  He starts but doesn't turn. I can see him give his head a slight shake. ""I didn't want to miss the party. It's for us, after all.""  I come up beside him and lean over the edge of the rail. The wide streets are full of dancing people. I squint to make out their tiny figures in more detail. ""Are they in costumes?""  ""Who could tell?"" Peeta answers. ""With all the crazy clothes they wear here. Couldn't sleep, either?""  ""Couldn't turn my mind off,"" I say.  ""Thinking about your family?"" he asks.  ""No,"" I admit a bit guiltily. ""All I can do is wonder about tomorrow. Which is pointless, of course."" In the light from below, I can see his face now, the awkward way he holds his bandaged hands. ""I really am sorry about your hands.""  ""It doesn't matter, Katniss,"" he says. ""I've never been a contender in these Games anyway.""  ""That's no way to be thinking,"" I say.  ""Why not? It's true. My best hope is to not disgrace myself and. "" He hesitates.  ""And what?"" I say.  ""I don't know how to say it exactly. Only. I want to die as myself. Does that make any sense?"" he asks. I shake my head. How could he die as anyone but himself? ""I don't want them to change me in there. Turn me into some kind of monster that I'm not.""  I bite my lip feeling inferior. While I've been ruminating on the availability of trees, Peeta has been struggling with how to maintain his identity. His purity of self. ""Do you mean you won't kill anyone?"" I ask.  ""No, when the time comes, I'm sure I'll kill just like everybody else. I can't go down without a fight. Only I keep wishing I could think of a way to. to show the Capitol they don't own me. That I'm more than just a piece in their Games,"" says Peeta.  ""But you're not,"" I say. ""None of us are. That's how the Games work.""  ""Okay, but within that framework, there's still you, there's still me,"" he insists. ""Don't you see?""  ""A little. Only. no offense, but who cares, Peeta?"" I say.  ""I do. I mean, what else am I allowed to care about at this point?"" he asks angrily. He's locked those blue eyes on mine now, demanding an answer.  I take a step back. ""Care about what Haymitch said. About staying alive.""  Peeta smiles at me, sad and mocking. ""Okay. Thanks for the tip, sweetheart.""  It's like a slap in the face. His use of Haymitch's patronizing endearment. ""Look, if you want to spend the last hours of your life planning some noble death in the arena, that's your choice. I want to spend mine in District Twelve.""  ""Wouldn't surprise me if you do,"" says Peeta. ""Give my mother my best when you make it back, will you?""  ""Count on it,"" I say. Then I turn and leave the roof. I spend the rest of the night slipping in and out of a doze, imagining the cutting remarks I will make to Peeta Mellark in the morning. Peeta Mellark. We will see how high and mighty he is when he's faced with life and death. He'll probably turn into one of those raging beast tributes, the kind who tries to eat someone's heart after they've killed them. There was a guy like that a few years ago from District 6 called Titus. He went completely savage and the Gamemakers had to have him stunned with electric guns to collect the bodies of the players he'd killed before he ate them. There are no rules in the arena, but cannibalism doesn't play well with the Capitol audience, so they tried to head it off. There was some speculation that the avalanche that finally took Titus out was specifically engineered to ensure the victor was not a lunatic.  I don't see Peeta in the morning. Cinna comes to me before dawn, gives me a simple shift to wear, and guides me to the roof. My final dressing and preparations will be alone in the catacombs under the arena itself. A hovercraft appears out of thin air, just like the one did in the woods the day I saw the redheaded Avox girl captured, and a ladder drops down. I place my hands and feet on the lower rungs and instantly it's as if I'm frozen. Some sort of current glues me to the ladder while I'm lifted safely inside.  I expect the ladder to release me then, but I'm still stuck when a woman in a white coat approaches me carrying a syringe. ""This is just your tracker, Katniss. The stiller you are, the more efficiently I can place it,"" she says.  Still? I'm a statue. But that doesn't prevent me from feeling the sharp stab of pain as the needle inserts the metal tracking device deep under the skin on the inside of my forearm. Now the Gamemakers will always be able to trace my whereabouts in the arena. Wouldn't want to lose a tribute.  As soon as the tracker's in place, the ladder releases me. The woman disappears and Cinna is retrieved from the roof, An Avox boy comes in and directs us to a room where breakfast has been laid out. Despite the tension in my stomach, I eat as much as I can, although none of the delectable food makes any impression on me. I'm so nervous, I could be eating coal dust. The one thing that distracts me at all is the view from the windows as we sail over the city and then to the wilderness beyond. This is what birds see. Only they're free and safe. The very opposite of me.  The ride lasts about half an hour before the windows black out, suggesting that we're nearing the arena. The hovercraft lands and Cinna and I go back to the ladder, only this time it leads down into a tube underground, into the catacombs that lie beneath the arena. We follow instructions to my destination, a chamber for my preparation. In the Capitol, they call it the Launch Room. In the districts, it's referred to as the Stockyard. The place animals go before slaughter.  Everything is brand-new, I will be the first and only tribute to use this Launch Room. The arenas are historic sites, preserved after the Games. Popular destinations for Capitol residents to visit, to vacation. Go for a month, rewatch the Games, tour the catacombs, visit the sites where the deaths took place. You can even take part in reenactments. They say the food is excellent.  I struggle to keep my breakfast down as I shower and clean my teeth. Cinna does my hair in my simple trademark braid down my back. Then the clothes arrive, the same for every tribute. Cinna has had no say in my outfit, does not even know what will be in the package, but he helps me dress in the undergarments, simple tawny pants, light green blouse, sturdy brown belt, and thin, hooded black jacket that falls to my thighs. ""The material in the jacket's designed to reflect body heat. Expect some cool nights,"" he says.  The boots, worn over skintight socks, are better than I could have hoped for. Soft leather not unlike my ones at home. These have a narrow flexible rubber sole with treads though. Good for running.  I think I'm finished when Cinna pulls the gold mockingjay pin from his pocket. I had completely forgotten about it.  ""Where did you get that?"" I ask.  ""Off the green outfit you wore on the train,"" he says. I remember now taking it off my mother's dress, pinning it to the shirt. ""It's your district token, right?"" I nod and he fastens it on my shirt. ""It barely cleared the review board. Some thought the pin could be used as a weapon, giving you an unfair advantage. But eventually, they let it through,"" says Cinna. ""They eliminated a ring from that District One girl, though. If you twisted the gemstone, a spike popped out. Poisoned one. She claimed she had no knowledge the ring transformed and there was no way to prove she did. But she lost her token. There, you're all set. Move around. Make sure everything feels comfortable.""  I walk, run in a circle, swing my arms about. ""Yes, it's fine. Fits perfectly.""  ""Then there's nothing to do but wait for the call,"" says Cinna. ""Unless you think you could eat any more?""  I turn down food but accept a glass of water that I take tiny sips of as we wait on a couch. I don't want to chew on my nails or lips, so I find myself gnawing on the inside of my cheek. It still hasn't fully healed from a few days ago. Soon the taste of blood fills my mouth.  Nervousness seeps into terror as I anticipate what is to come. I could be dead, flat-out dead, in an hour. Not even. My fingers obsessively trace the hard little lump on my forearm where the woman injected the tracking device. I press on it, even though it hurts, I press on it so hard a small bruise begins to form.  ""Do you want to talk, Katniss?"" Cinna asks.  I shake my head but after a moment hold out my hand to him. Cinna encloses it in both of his. And this is how we sit until a pleasant female voice announces it's time to prepare for launch.  Still clenching one of Cinna's hands, I walk over and stand on the circular metal plate. ""Remember what Haymitch said. Run, find water. The rest will follow,"" he says. I nod. ""And remember this. I'm not allowed to bet, but if I could, my money would be on you.""  ""Truly?"" I whisper.  ""Truly,"" says Cinna. He leans down and kisses me on the forehead. ""Good luck, girl on fire."" And then a glass cylinder is lowering around me, breaking our handhold, cutting him off from me. He taps his fingers under his chin. Head high.  I lift my chin and stand as straight as I can. The cylinder begins to rise. For maybe fifteen seconds, I'm in darkness and then I can feel the metal plate pushing me out of the cylinder, into the open air. For a moment, my eyes are dazzled by the bright sunlight and I'm conscious only of a strong wind with the hopeful smell of pine trees.  Then I hear the legendary announcer, Claudius Templesmith, as his voice booms all around me.  ""Ladies and gentlemen, let the Seventy-fourth Hunger Games begin!"""
Hunger Games Chapter 11,"Sixty seconds. That's how long we're required to stand on our metal circles before the sound of a gong releases us. Step off before the minute is up, and land mines blow your legs off. Sixty seconds to take in the ring of tributes all equidistant from the Cornucopia, a giant golden horn shaped like a cone with a curved tail, the mouth of which is at least twenty feet high, spilling over with the things that will give us life here in the arena. Food, containers of water, weapons, medicine, garments, fire starters. Strewn around the Cornucopia are other supplies, their value decreasing the farther they are from the horn. For instance, only a few steps from my feet lays a three-foot square of plastic. Certainly it could be of some use in a downpour. But there in the mouth, I can see a tent pack that would protect from almost any sort of weather. If I had the guts to go in and fight for it against the other twenty-three tributes. Which I have been instructed not to do.  We're on a flat, open stretch of ground. A plain of hard-packed dirt. Behind the tributes across from me, I can see nothing, indicating either a steep downward slope or even cliff. To my right lies a lake. To my left and back, spars piney woods. This is where Haymitch would want me to go. Immediately.  I hear his instructions in my head. ""Just clear out, put as much distance as you can between yourselves and the others, and find a source of water.""  But it's tempting, so tempting, when I see the bounty waiting there before me. And I know that if I don't get it, someone else will. That the Career Tributes who survive the bloodbath will divide up most of these life-sustaining spoils. Something catches my eye. There, resting on a mound of blanket rolls, is a silver sheath of arrows and a bow, already strung, just waiting to be engaged. That's mine, I think. It's meant for me.  I'm fast. I can sprint faster than any of the girls in our school although a couple can beat me in distance races. But this forty-yard length, this is what I am built for. I know I can get it, I know I can reach it first, but then the question is how quickly can I get out of there? By the time I've scrambled up the packs and grabbed the weapons, others will have reached the horn, and one or two I might be able to pick off, but say there's a dozen, at that close range, they could take me down with the spears and the clubs. Or their own powerful fists.  Still, I won't be the only target. I'm betting many of the other tributes would pass up a smaller girl, even one who scored an eleven in training, to take out their more fierce adversaries.  Haymitch has never seen me run. Maybe if he had he'd tell me to go for it. Get the weapon. Since that's the very weapon that might be my salvation. And I only see one bow in that whole pile. I know the minute must be almost up and will have to decide what my strategy will be and I find myself positioning my feet to run, not away into the stir rounding forests but toward the pile, toward the bow. When suddenly I notice Peeta, he's about five tributes to my right, quite a fair distance, still I can tell he's looking at me and I think he might be shaking his head. But the sun's in my eyes, and while I'm puzzling over it the gong rings out.  And I've missed it! I've missed my chance! Because those extra couple of seconds I've lost by not being ready are enough to change my mind about going in. My feet shuffle for a moment, confused at the direction my brain wants to take and then I lunge forward, scoop up the sheet of plastic and a loaf of bread. The pickings are so small and I'm so angry with Peeta for distracting me that I sprint in twenty yards to retrieve a bright orange backpack that could hold anything because I can't stand leaving with virtually nothing.  A boy, I think from District 9, reaches the pack at the same time I do and for a brief time we grapple for it and then he coughs, splattering my face with blood. I stagger back, repulsed by the warm, sticky spray. Then the boy slips to the ground. That's when I see the knife in his back. Already other tributes have reached the Cornucopia and are spreading out to attack. Yes, the girl from District 2, ten yards away, running toward me, one hand clutching a half-dozen knives. I've seen her throw in training. She never misses. And I'm her next target.  All the general fear I've been feeling condenses into at immediate fear of this girl, this predator who might kill me in seconds. Adrenaline shoots through me and I sling the pack over one shoulder and run full-speed for the woods. I can hear the blade whistling toward me and reflexively hike the pack up to protect my head. The blade lodges in the pack. Both straps on my shoulders now, I make for the trees. Somehow I know the girl will not pursue me. That she'll be drawn back into the Cornucopia before all the good stuff is gone. A grin crosses my face. Thanks for the knife, I think.  At the edge of the woods I turn for one instant to survey the field. About a dozen or so tributes are hacking away at one another at the horn. Several lie dead already on the ground. Those who have taken flight are disappearing into the trees or into the void opposite me. I continue running until the woods have hidden me from the other tributes then slow into a steady jog that I think I can maintain for a while. For the next few hours, I alternate between jogging and walking, putting as much distance as I can between myself and my competitors. I lost my bread during the struggle with the boy from District 9 but managed to stuff my plastic in my sleeve so as I walk I fold it neatly and tuck it into a pocket. I also free the knife  -  it's a fine one with a long sharp blade, serrated near the handle, which will make it handy for sawing through things  -  and slide it into my belt. I don't dare stop to examine the contents of the pack yet. I just keep moving, pausing only to check for pursuers.  I can go a long time. I know that from my days in the woods. But I will need water. That was Haymitch's second instruction, and since I sort of botched the first, I keep a sharp eye out for any sign of it. No luck.  The woods begin to evolve, and the pines are intermixed with a variety of trees, some I recognize, some completely foreign to me. At one point, I hear a noise and pull my knife, thinking I may have to defend myself, but I've only startled a rabbit. ""Good to see you,"" I whisper. If there's one rabbit, there could be hundreds just waiting to be snared.  The ground slopes down. I don't particularly like this. Valleys make me feel trapped. I want to be high, like in the hills around District 12, where I can see my enemies approaching. But I have no choice but to keep going.  Funny though, I don't feel too bad. The days of gorging myself have paid off. I've got staying power even though I'm short on sleep. Being in the woods is rejuvenating. I'm glad for the solitude, even though it's an illusion, because I'm probably on-screen right now. Not consistently but off and on. There are so many deaths to show the first day that a tribute trekking through the woods isn't much to look at. But they'll show me enough to let people know I'm alive, uninjured and on the move. One of the heaviest days of betting is the opening, when the initial casualties come in. But that can't compare to what happens as the field shrinks to a handful of players.  It's late afternoon when I begin to hear the cannons. Each shot represents a dead tribute. The fighting must have finally stopped at the Cornucopia. They never collect the bloodbath bodies until the killers have dispersed. On the opening day, they don't even fire the cannons until the initial fighting's over because it's too hard to keep track of the fatalities. I allow myself to pause, panting, as I count the shots. One. two. three. on and on until they reach eleven. Eleven dead in all. Thirteen left to play. My fingernails scrape at the dried blood the boy from District 9 coughed into my face. He's gone, certainly. I wonder about Peeta. Has he lasted through the day? I'll know in a few hours. When they project the dead's images into the sky for the rest of us to see.  All of a sudden, I'm overwhelmed by the thought that Peeta may be already lost, bled white, collected, and in the process of being transported back to the Capitol to be cleaned up, redressed, and shipped in a simple wooden box back to District 12. No longer here. Heading home. I try hard to remember if I saw him once the action started. But the last image I can conjure up is Peeta shaking his head as the gong rang out.  Maybe it's better, if he's gone already. He had no confidence he could win. And I will not end up with the unpleasant task of killing him. Maybe it's better if he's out of this for good.  I slump down next to my pack, exhausted. I need to go through it anyway before night falls. See what I have to work with. As I unhook the straps, I can feel it's sturdily made although a rather unfortunate color. This orange will practically glow in the dark. I make a mental note to camouflage it first thing tomorrow.  I flip open the flap. What I want most, right at this moment, is water. Haymitch's directive to immediately find water was not arbitrary. I won't last long without it. For a few days, I'll be able to function with unpleasant symptoms of dehydration, but after that I'll deteriorate into helplessness and be dead in a week, tops. I carefully lay out the provisions. One thin black sleeping bag that reflects body heal. A pack of crackers. A pack of dried beef strips. A bottle of iodine. A box of wooden matches. A small coil of wire. A pair of sunglasses. And a half-gallon plastic bottle with a cap for carrying water that's bone dry.  No water. How hard would it have been for them to fill up the bottle? I become aware of the dryness in my throat and mouth, the cracks in my lips. I've been moving all day long. It's been hot and I've sweat a lot. I do this at home, but there are always streams to drink from, or snow to melt if it should come to it.  As I refill my pack I have an awful thought. The lake. The one I saw while I was waiting for the gong to sound. What if that's the only water source in the arena? That way they'll guarantee drawing us in to fight. The lake is a full day's journey from where I sit now, a much harder journey with nothing to drink. And then, even if I reach it, it's sure to be heavily guarded by some of the Career Tributes. I'm about to panic when I remember the rabbit I startled earlier today. It has to drink, too. I just have to find out where.  Twilight is closing in and I am ill at ease. The trees are too thin to offer much concealment. The layer of pine needles that muffles my footsteps also makes tracking animals harder when I need their trails to find water. And I'm still heading downhill, deeper and deeper into a valley that seems endless.  I'm hungry, too, but I don't dare break into my precious store of crackers and beef yet. Instead, I take my knife and go to work on a pine tree, cutting away the outer bark and scraping off a large handful of the softer inner bark. I slowly chew the stuff as I walk along. After a week of the finest food in the world, it's a little hard to choke down. But I've eaten plenty of pine in my life. I'll adjust quickly.  In another hour, it's clear I've got to find a place to camp. Night creatures are coming out. I can hear the occasional hoot or howl, my first clue that I'll be competing with natural predators for the rabbits. As to whether I'll be viewed as a source of food, it's too soon to tell. There could be any number of animals stalking me at this moment.  But right now, I decide to make my fellow tributes a priority. I'm sure many will continue hunting through the night. Those who fought it out at the Cornucopia will have food, an abundance of water from the lake, torches or flashlights, and weapons they're itching to use. I can only hope I've traveled far and fast enough to be out of range.  Before settling down, I take my wire and set two twitch-up snares in the brush. I know it's risky to be setting traps, but food will go so fast out here. And I can't set snares on the run. Still, I walk another five minutes before making camp.  I pick my tree carefully. A willow, not terribly tall but set in a clump of other willows, offering concealment in those long, flowing tresses. I climb up, sticking to the stronger branches close to the trunk, and find a sturdy fork for my bed. It takes some doing, but I arrange the sleeping bag in a relatively comfortable manner. I place my backpack in the foot of the bag, then slide in after it. As a precaution, I remove my belt, loop it all the way around the branch and my sleeping bag, and refasten it at my waist. Now if I roll over in my sleep, I won't go crashing to the ground. I'm small enough to tuck the top of the bag over my head, but I put on my hood as well. As night falls, the air is cooling quickly. Despite the risk I took in getting the backpack, I know now it was the right choice. This sleeping bag, radiating back and preserving my body heat, will be invaluable. I'm sure there are several other tributes whose biggest concern right now is how to stay warm whereas I may actually be able to get a few hours of sleep. If only I wasn't so thirsty.  Night has just come when I hear the anthem that proceeds the death recap. Through the branches I can see the seal of the Capitol, which appears to be floating in the sky. I'm actually viewing another screen, an enormous one that's transported by of one of their disappearing hovercraft. The anthem fades out and the sky goes dark for a moment. At home, we would be watching full coverage of each and every killing, but that's thought to give an unfair advantage to the living tributes. For instance, if I got my hands on the bow and shot someone, my secret would be revealed to all. No, here in the arena, all we see are the same photographs they showed when they televised our training scores. Simple head shots. But now instead of scores they post only district numbers. I take a deep breath as the face of the eleven dead tributes begin and tick them off one by one on my fingers.  The first to appear is the girl from District 3. That means that the Career Tributes from 1 and 2 have all survived. No surprise there. Then the boy from 4. I didn't expect that one, usually all the Careers make it through the first day. The boy from District 5. I guess the fox-faced girl made it. Both tributes from 6 and 7. The boy from 8. Both from 9. Yes, there's the boy who I fought for the backpack. I've run through my fingers, only one more dead tribute to go. Is it Peeta? No, there's the girl from District 10. That's it. The Capitol seal is back with a final musical flourish. Then darkness and the sounds of the forest resume.  I'm relieved Peeta's alive. I tell myself again that if I get killed, his winning will benefit my mother and Prim the most. This is what I tell myself to explain the conflicting emotions that arise when I think of Peeta. The gratitude that he gave me an edge by professing his love for me in the interview. The anger at his superiority on the roof. The dread that we may come face-to-face at any moment in this arena.  Eleven dead, but none from District 12. I try to work out who is left. Five Career Tributes. Foxface. Thresh and Rue. Rue. so she made it through the first day after all. I can't help feeling glad. That makes ten of us. The other three I'll figure out tomorrow. Now when it is dark, and I have traveled far, and I am nestled high in this tree, now I must try and rest.  I haven't really slept in two days, and then there's been the long day's journey into the arena. Slowly, I allow my muscles to relax. My eyes to close. The last thing I think is it's lucky I don't snore.  Snap! The sound of a breaking branch wakes me. How long have I been asleep? Four hours? Five? The tip of my nose is icy cold. Snap! Snap! What's going on? This is not the sound of a branch under someone's foot, but the sharp crack of one coming from a tree. Snap! Snap! I judge it to be several hundred yards to my right. Slowly, noiselessly, I turn myself in that direction. For a few minutes, there's nothing but blackness and some scuffling. Then I see a spark and a small fire begins to bloom. A pair of hands warms over flames, but I can't make out more than that.  I have to bite my lip not to scream every foul name I know at the fire starter. What are they thinking? A fire I'll just at nightfall would have been one thing. Those who battled at the Cornucopia, with their superior strength and surplus of supplies, they couldn't possibly have been near enough to spot the flames then. But now, when they've probably been combing the woods for hours looking for victims. You might as well be waving a flag and shouting, ""Come and get me!""  And here I am a stone's throw from the biggest idiot in the Games. Strapped in a tree. Not daring to flee since my general location has just been broadcast to any killer who cares. I mean, I know it's cold out here and not everybody has a sleeping bag. But then you grit your teeth and stick it out until dawn!  I lay smoldering in my bag for the next couple of hours really thinking that if I can get out of this tree, I won't have the least problem taking out my new neighbor. My instinct has been to flee, not fight. But obviously this person's a hazard. Stupid people are dangerous. And this one probably doesn't have much in the way of weapons while I've got this excellent knife.  The sky is still dark, but I can feel the first signs of dawn approaching. I'm beginning to think we  -  meaning the person whose death I'm now devising and me  -  we might actually have gone unnoticed. Then I hear it. Several pairs of feet breaking into a run. The fire starter must have dozed off. They're on her before she can escape. I know it's a girl now, I can tell by the pleading, the agonized scream that follows. Then there's laughter and congratulations from several voices. Someone cries out, ""Twelve down and eleven to go!"" which gets a round of appreciative hoots.  So they're fighting in a pack. I'm not really surprised. Often alliances are formed in the early stages of the Games. The strong band together to hunt down the weak then, when the tension becomes too great, begin to turn on one another. I don't have to wonder too hard who has made this alliance. It'll be the remaining Career Tributes from Districts 1, 2, and 4. Two boys and three girls. The ones who lunched together.  For a moment, I hear them checking the girl for supplies. I can tell by their comments they've found nothing good. I wonder if the victim is Rue but quickly dismiss the thought. She's much too bright to be building a fire like that.  ""Better clear out so they can get the body before it starts stinking."" I'm almost certain that's the brutish boy from District 2. There are murmurs of assent and then, to my horror, I hear the pack heading toward me. They do not know I'm here. How could they? And I'm well concealed in the clump of trees. At least while the sun stays down. Then my black sleeping bag will turn from camouflage to trouble. If they just keep moving, they will pass me and be gone in a minute.  But the Careers stop in the clearing about ten yards from my tree. They have flashlights, torches. I can see an arm here, a boot there, through the breaks in the branches. I turn to stone, not even daring to breathe. Have they spotted me? No, not yet. I can tell from their words their minds are elsewhere.  ""Shouldn't we have heard a cannon by now?""  ""I'd say yes. Nothing to prevent them from going in immediately.""  ""Unless she isn't dead.""  ""She's dead. I stuck her myself.""  ""Then where's the cannon?""  ""Someone should go back. Make sure the job's done.""  ""Yeah, we don't want to have to track her down twice.""  ""I said she's dead!""  An argument breaks out until one tribute silences the others. ""We're wasting time! I'll go finish her and let's move on!""  I almost fall out of the tree. The voice belongs to Peeta."
Hunger Games Chapter 12,"Thank goodness, I had the foresight to belt myself in. I've rolled sideways off the fork and I'm facing the ground, held in place by the belt, one hand, and my feet straddling the pack inside my sleeping bag, braced against the trunk. There must have been some rustling when I tipped sideways, but the Careers have been too caught up in their own argument to catch it.  ""Go on, then, Lover Boy,"" says the boy from District 2. ""See for yourself.""  I just get a glimpse of Peeta, lit by a torch, heading back to the girl by the fire. His face is swollen with bruises, there's a bloody bandage on one arm, and from the sound of his gait he's limping somewhat. I remember him shaking him his head, telling me not to go into the fight for the supplies, when all along, all along he'd planned to throw himself into the thick of things. Just the opposite of what Haymitch had mid him to do.  Okay, I can stomach that. Seeing all those supplies was tempting. But this. this other thing. This teaming up with the Career wolf pack to hunt down the rest of us. No one from District 12 would think of doing such a thing! Career tributes are overly vicious, arrogant, better fed, but only because they're the Capitol's lapdogs.  Universally, solidly hated by all but those from their own districts. I can imagine the things they're saying about him back home now. And Peeta had the gall to talk to me about disgrace?  Obviously, the noble boy on the rooftop was playing just one more game with me. But this will be his last. I will eagerly watch the night skies for signs of his death, if I don't kill him first myself.  The Career tributes are silent until he gets out of ear shot, then use hushed voices.  ""Why don't we just kill him now and get it over with?""  ""Let him tag along. What's the harm? And he's handy with that knife.""  Is he? That's news. What a lot of interesting things I'm learning about my friend Peeta today.  ""Besides, he's our best chance of finding her.""  It takes me a moment to register that the ""her"" they're referring to is me.  ""Why? You think she bought into that sappy romance stuff?""  ""She might have. Seemed pretty simpleminded to me. Every time I think about her spinning around in that dress, I want to puke.""  ""Wish we knew how she got that eleven.""  ""Bet you Lover Boy knows.""  The sound of Peeta returning silences them.  ""Was she dead?"" asks the boy from District 2.  ""No. But she is now,"" says Peeta. Just then, the cannon fires. ""Ready to move on?""  The Career pack sets off at a run just as dawn begins to break, and birdsong fills the air. I remain in my awkward position, muscles trembling with exertion for a while longer, then hoist myself back onto my branch. I need to get down, to get going, but for a moment I lie there, digesting what I've heard. Not only is Peeta with the Careers, he's helping them find me. The simpleminded girl who has to be taken seriously because of her eleven. Because she can use a bow and arrow. Which Peeta knows better than anyone.  But he hasn't told them yet. Is he saving that information because he knows it's all that keeps him alive? Is he still pretending to love me for the audience? What is going on in his head?  Suddenly, the birds fall silent. Then one gives a high-pitched warning call. A single note. Just like the one Gale and I heard when the redheaded Avox girl was caught. High above the dying campfire a hovercraft materializes. A set of huge metal teeth drops down. Slowly, gently, the dead tribute girl is lifted into the hovercraft. Then it vanishes. The birds resume their song.  ""Move,"" I whisper to myself. I wriggle out of my sleeping bag, roll it up, and place it in the pack. I take a deep breath. While I've been concealed by darkness and the sleeping bag and the willow branches, it has probably been difficult for the cameras to get a good shot of me. I know they must be tracking me now though. The minute I hit the ground, I'm guaranteed a close-up.  The audience will have been beside themselves, knowing I was in the tree, that I overheard the Careers talking, that I discovered Peeta was with them. Until I work out exactly how I want to play that, I'd better at least act on top of things. Not perplexed. Certainly not confused or frightened.  No, I need to look one step ahead of the game.  So as I slide out of the foliage and into the dawn light, I pause a second, giving the cameras time to lock on me. Then I cock my head slightly to the side and give a knowing smile. There! Let them figure out what that means!  I'm about to take off when I think of my snares. Maybe it's imprudent to check them with the others so close. But have to. Too many years of hunting, I guess. And the lure of possible meat. I'm rewarded with one fine rabbit. In no time, I've cleaned and gutted the animal, leaving the head, feet, tail, skin, and innards, under a pile of leaves. I'm wishing for a fire  -  eating raw rabbit can give you rabbit fever, a lesson I learned the hard way  -  when I think of the dead tribute. I hurry back to her camp. Sure enough, the coals of her dying fire are still hot. I cut up the rabbit, fashion a spit out of branches, and set it over the coals.  I'm glad for the cameras now. I want sponsors to see I can hunt, that I'm a good bet because I won't be lured into traps as easily as the others will by hunger. While the rabbit cooks, I grind up part of a charred branch and set about camouflaging my orange pack. The black tones it down, but I feel a layer of mud would definitely help. Of course, to have mud, I'd need water.  I pull on my gear, grab my spit, kick some dirt over the coals, and take off in the opposite direction the Careers went. I eat half the rabbit as I go, then wrap up the leftovers in my plastic for later. The meat stops the grumbling in my stomach but does little to quench my thirst. Water is my top priority now.  As I hike along, I feel certain I'm still holding the screen in the Capitol, so I'm careful to continue to hide my emotions. But what a good time Claudius Templesmith must be having with his guest commentators, dissecting Peeta's behavior, my reaction. What to make of it all? Has Peeta revealed his true colors? How does this affect the betting odds? Will we lose sponsors? Do we even have sponsors? Yes, I feel certain we do, or at least did.  Certainly Peeta has thrown a wrench into our star-crossed lover dynamic. Or has he? Maybe, since he hasn't spoken much about me, we can still get some mileage out of it. Maybe people will think it's something we plotted together if I seem like it amuses me now.  The sun rises in the sky and even through the canopy it seems overly bright. I coat my lips in some grease from the rabbit and try to keep from panting, but it's no use. It's only been a day and I'm dehydrating fast. I try and think of everything I know about finding water. It runs downhill, so, in fact, continuing down into this valley isn't a bad thing. If I could just locate a game trail or spot a particularly green patch of vegetation, these might help me along, but nothing seems to change. There's just the slight gradual slope, the birds, the sameness to the trees.  As the day wears on, I know I'm headed for trouble. What little urine I've been able to pass is a dark brown, my head is aching, and there's a dry patch on my tongue that refuses to moisten. The sun hurts my eyes so I dig out my sunglasses, but when I put them on they do something funny to my vision, so I just stuff them back in my pack.  It's late afternoon when I think I've found help. I spot a cluster of berry bushes and hurry to strip the fruit, to suck the sweet juices from the skins. But just as I'm holding them to my lips, I get a hard look at them. What I thought were blueberries have a slightly different shape, and when I break one open the insides are bloodred. I don't recognize these berries, perhaps they are edible, but I'm guessing this is some evil trick on the part of the Gamemakers. Even the plant instructor in the Training Center made a point of telling us to avoid berries unless you were 100 percent sure they weren't toxic. Something I already knew, but I'm so thirsty it takes her reminder to give me the strength to fling them away.  Fatigue is beginning to settle on me, but it's not the usual tiredness that follows a long hike. I have to stop and rest frequently, although I know the only cure for what ails me requires continued searching. I try a new tactic  -  climbing a tree as high as I dare in my shaky state  -  to look for any signs of water. But as far as I can see in any direction, there's the same unrelenting stretch of forest.  Determined to go on until nightfall, I walk until I'm stumbling over my own feet.  Exhausted, I haul myself up into a tree and belt myself in. I've no appetite, but I suck on a rabbit bone just to give my mouth something to do. Night falls, the anthem plays, and high in the sky I see the picture of the girl, who was apparently from District 8. The one Peeta went back to finish off.  My fear of the Career pack is minor compared to my burning thirst. Besides, they were heading away from me and by now they, too, will have to rest. With the scarcity of water, they may even have had to return to the lake for refills.  Maybe, that is the only course for me as well.  Morning brings distress. My heads throbs with every beat of my heart. Simple movements send stabs of pain through my joints. I fall, rather than jump from the tree. It takes several minutes for me to assemble my gear. Somewhere inside me, I know this is wrong. I should be acting with more caution, moving with more urgency. But my mind seems foggy and forming a plan is hard. I lean back against the trunk of my tree, one finger gingerly stroking the sandpaper surface of my tongue, as I assess my options. How can I get water?  Return to the lake. No good. I'd never make it.  Hope for rain. There's not a cloud in the sky.  Keep looking. Yes, this is my only chance. But then, another thought hits me, and the surge of anger that follows brings me to me senses.  Haymitch! He could send me water! Press a button and have it delivered to me in a silver parachute in minutes. I know I must have sponsors, at least one or two who could afford a pint of liquid for me. Yes, it's pricey, but these people, they're made of money. And they'll be betting on me as well. Perhaps Haymitch doesn't realize how deep my need is.  I say in a voice as loud as I dare. ""Water."" I wait, hopefully, for a parachute to descend from the sky. But nothing is forthcoming.  Something is wrong. Am I deluded about having sponsors? Or has Peeta's behavior made them all hang back? No, I don't believe it. There's someone out there who wants to buy me water only Haymitch is refusing to let it go through. As my mentor, he gets to control the flow of gifts from the sponsors. I know he hates me. He's made that clear enough. But enough to let me die? From this? He can't do that, can he? If a mentor mistreats his tributes, he'll be held accountable by the viewers, by the people back in District 12. Even Haymitch wouldn't risk that, would he? Say what you will about my fellow traders in the Hob, but I don't think they'd welcome him back there if he let me die this way. And then where would he get his liquor? So. what? Is he trying to make me suffer for defying him? Is he directing all the sponsors toward Peeta? Is he just too drunk to even notice what's going on at the moment? Somehow I don't believe that and I don't believe he's trying to kill me off by neglect, either. He has, in fact, in his own unpleasant way, genuinely been trying to prepare me for this. Then what is going on?  I bury my face in my hands. There's no danger of tears now, I couldn't produce one to save my life. What is Haymitch doing? Despite my anger, hatred, and suspicions, a small voice in the back of my head whispers an answer.  Maybe he's sending you a message, it says. A message. Saying what? Then I know. There's only one good reason Haymitch could be withholding water from me. Because he knows I've almost found it.  I grit my teeth and pull myself to my feet. My backpack seems to have tripled in weight. I find a broken branch that will do for a walking stick and I start off. The sun's beating down, even more searing than the first two days. I feel like an old piece of leather, drying and cracking in the heat. every step is an effort, but I refuse to stop. I refuse to sit down. If I sit, there's a good chance I won't be able to get up again, that I won't even remember my task.  What easy prey I am! Any tribute, even tiny Rue, could take me right now, merely shove me over and kill me with my own knife, and I'd have little strength to resist. But if anyone is in my part of the woods, they ignore me. The truth is, I feel a million miles from another living soul.  Not alone though. No, they've surely got a camera tracking me now. I think back to the years of watching tributes starve, freeze, bleed, and dehydrate to death. Unless there's a really good fight going on somewhere, I'm being featured.  My thoughts turn to Prim. It's likely she won't be watching me live, but they'll show updates at the school during lunch. For her sake, I try to look as least desperate as I can.  But by afternoon, I know the end is coming. My legs are shaking and my heart too quick. I keep forgetting, exactly what I'm doing. I've stumbled repeatedly and managed to regain my feet, but when the stick slides out from under me, I finally tumble to the ground unable to get up. I let my eyes close.  I have misjudged Haymitch. He has no intention of helping me at all.  This is all right, I think. This is not so bad here. The air is less hot, signifying evening's approach. There's a slight, sweet scent that reminds me of lilies. My fingers stroke the smooth ground, sliding easily across the top. This is an okay place to die, I think.  My fingertips make small swirling patterns in the cool, slippery earth. I love mud, I think. How many times I've tracked game with the help of its soft, readable surface. Good for bee stings, too. Mud. Mud. Mud! My eyes fly open and I dig my fingers into the earth. It is mud! My nose lifts in the air. And those are lilies! Pond lilies!  I crawl now, through the mud, dragging myself toward the scent. Five yards from where I fell, I crawl through a tangle of plants into a pond. Floating on the top, yellow flowers in bloom, are my beautiful lilies.  It's all I can do not to plunge my face into the water and gulp down as much as I can hold. But I have just enough sense left to abstain. With trembling hands, I get out my flask and fill it with water. I add what I remember to be the right number of drops of iodine for purifying it. The half an hour of waiting is agony, but I do it. At least, I think it's a half an hour, but it's certainly as long as I can stand.  Slowly, easy now, I tell myself. I take one swallow and make myself wait. Then another. Over the next couple of hours, I drink the entire half gallon. Then a second. I prepare another before I retire to a tree where I continue sipping, eating rabbit, and even indulge in one of my precious crackers. By the time the anthem plays, I feel remarkably better. There are no faces tonight, no tributes died today. Tomorrow I'll stay here, resting, camouflaging my backpack with mud, catching some of those little fish I saw as I sipped, digging up the roots of the pond lilies to make a nice meal. I snuggle down in my sleeping bag, hanging on to my water bottle for dear life, which, of course, it is.  A few hours later, the stampede of feet shakes me from slumber. I look around in bewilderment. It's not yet dawn, but my stinging eyes can see it.  It would be hard to miss the wall of fire descending on me."
Hunger Games Chapter 13,"My first impulse is to scramble from the tree, but I'm belted in. Somehow my fumbling fingers release the buckle and I fall to the ground in a heap, still snarled in my sleeping bag. There's no time for any kind of packing. Fortunately, my backpack and water bottle are already in the bag. I shove in the belt, hoist the bag over my shoulder, and flee.  The world has transformed to flame and smoke. Burning branches crack from trees and fall in showers of sparks at my feet. All I can do is follow the others, the rabbits and deer and I even spot a wild dog pack shooting through the woods. I trust their sense of direction because their instincts are sharper than mine. But they are much faster, flying through the underbrush so gracefully as my boots catch on roots and fallen tree limbs, that there's no way I can keep apace with them.  The heat is horrible, but worse than the heat is the smoke, which threatens to suffocate me at any moment. I pull the top of my shirt up over my nose, grateful to find it soaked in sweat, and it offers a thin veil of protection. And I run, choking, my bag banging against my back, my face cut with branches that materialize from the gray haze without warning, because I know I am supposed to run.  This was no tribute's campfire gone out of control, no accidental occurrence. The flames that bear down on me have an unnatural height, a uniformity that marks them as human-made, machine-made, Gamemaker-made. Things have been too quiet today. No deaths, perhaps no fights at all. The audience in the Capitol will be getting bored, claiming that these Games are verging on dullness. This is the one thing the Games must not do.  It's not hard to follow the Gamemakers' motivation. There is the Career pack and then there are the rest of us, probably spread far and thin across the arena. This fire is designed to flush us out, to drive us together. It may not be the most original device I've seen, but it's very, very effective.  I hurdle over a burning log. Not high enough. The tail end of my jacket catches on fire and I have to stop to rip it from my body and stamp out the flames. But I don't dare leave the jacket, scorched and smoldering as it is, I take the risk of shoving it in my sleeping bag, hoping the lack of air will quell what I haven't extinguished. This is all I have, what I carry on my back, and it's little enough to survive with.  In a matter of minutes, my throat and nose are burning. The coughing begins soon after and my lungs begin to feel as if they are actually being cooked. Discomfort turns to distress until each breath sends a searing pain through my chest. I manage to take cover under a stone outcropping just as the vomiting begins, and I lose my meager supper and whatever water has remained in my stomach. Crouching on my hands and knees, I retch until there's nothing left to come up.  I know I need to keep moving, but I'm trembling and light-headed now, gasping for air. I allow myself about a spoonful of water to rinse my mouth and spit then take a few swallows from my bottle. You get one minute, I tell myself. One minute to rest. I take the time to reorder my supplies, wad up the sleeping bag, and messily stuff everything into the backpack. My minute's up. I know it's time to move on, but the smoke has clouded my thoughts. The swift-footed animals that were my compass have left me behind. I know I haven't been in this part of the woods before, there were no sizable rocks like the one I'm sheltering against on my earlier travels. Where are the Gamemakers driving me? Back to the lake? To a whole new terrain filled with new dangers? I had just found a few hours of peace at the pond when this attack began. Would there be any way I could travel parallel to the fire and work my way back there, to a source of water at least? The wall of fire must have an end and it won't burn indefinitely. Not because the Gamemakers couldn't keep it fueled but because, again, that would invite accusations of boredom from the audience. If I could get back behind the fire line, I could avoid meeting up with the Careers. I've just decided to try and loop back around, although it will require miles of travel away from the inferno and then a very circuitous route back, when the first fireball blasts into the rock about two feet from my head. I spring out from under my ledge, energized by renewed fear.  The game has taken a twist. The fire was just to get us moving, now the audience will get to see some real fun. When I hear the next hiss, I flatten on the ground, not taking time to look. The fireball hits a tree off to my left, engulfing it in flames. To remain still is death. I'm barely on my feet before the third ball hits the ground where I was lying, sending a pillar of fire up behind me. Time loses meaning now as I frantically try to dodge the attacks. I can't see where they're being launched from, but it's not a hovercraft. The angles are not extreme enough. Probably this whole segment of the woods has been armed with precision launchers that are concealed in trees or rocks. Somewhere, in a cool and spotless room, a Gamemaker sits at a set of controls, fingers on the triggers that could end my life in a second. All that is needed is a direct hit.  Whatever vague plan I had conceived regarding returning to my pond is wiped from my mind as I zigzag and dive and leap to avoid the fireballs. Each one is only the size of an apple, but packs tremendous power on contact. Every sense I have goes into overdrive as the need to survive takes over. There's no time to judge if a move is the correct one. When there's a hiss, I act or die.  Something keeps me moving forward, though. A lifetime of watching the Hunger Games lets me know that certain areas of the arena are rigged for certain attacks. And that if I can just get away from this section, I might be able to move out of reach of the launchers. I might also then fall straight into a pit of vipers, but I can't worry about that now.  How long I scramble along dodging the fireballs I can't say, but the attacks finally begin to abate. Which is good, because I'm retching again. This time it's an acidic substance that scalds my throat and makes its way into my nose as well. I'm forced to stop as my body convulses, trying desperately to rid itself of the poisons I've been sucking in during the attack. I wait for the next hiss, the next signal to bolt. It doesn't come. The force of the retching has squeezed tears out of my stinging eyes. My clothes are drenched in sweat. Somehow, through the smoke and vomit, I pick up the scent of singed hair. My hand fumbles to my braid and finds a fireball has seared off at least six inches of it. Strands of blackened hair crumble in my fingers. I stare at them, fascinated by the transformation, when the hissing registers.  My muscles react, only not fast enough this time. The fireball crashes into the ground at my side, but not before it skids across my right calf. Seeing my pants leg on fire sends me over the edge. I twist and scuttle backward on my hands and feet, shrieking, trying to remove myself from the horror. When I finally regain enough sense, I roll the leg back and forth on the ground, which stifles the worst of it. But then, without thinking, I rip away the remaining fabric with my bare hands.  I sit on the ground, a few yards from the blaze set off by the fireball. My calf is screaming, my hands covered in red welts. I'm shaking too hard to move. If the Gamemakers want to finish me off, now is the time.  I hear Cinna's voice, carrying images of rich fabric and sparkling gems. ""Katniss, the girl who was on fire."" What a good laugh the Gamemakers must be having over that one. Perhaps, Cinna's beautiful costumes have even brought on this particular torture for me. I know he couldn't have foreseen this, must be hurting for me because, in fact, I believe he cares about me. But all in all, maybe showing up stark naked in that chariot would have been safer for me.  The attack is now over. The Gamemakers don't want me dead. Not yet anyway. Everyone knows they could destroy us all within seconds of the opening gong. The real sport of the Hunger Games is watching the tributes kill one another. Every so often, they do kill a tribute just to remind the players they can. But mostly, they manipulate us into confronting one another face-to-face. Which means, if I am no longer being fired at, there is at least one other tribute close at hand.  I would drag myself into a tree and take cover now if I could, but the smoke is still thick enough to kill me. I make myself stand and begin to limp away from the wall of flames that lights up the sky. It does not seem to be pursuing me any longer, except with its stinking black clouds.  Another light, daylight, begins to softly emerge. Swirls of smoke catch the sunbeams. My visibility is poor. I can see maybe fifteen yards in any direction. A tribute could easily be concealed from me here. I should draw my knife as a precaution, but I doubt my ability to hold it for long. The pain in my hands can in no way compete with that in my calf. I hate burns, have always hated them, even a small one gotten from pulling a pan of bread from the oven. It is the worst kind of pain to me, but I have never experienced anything like this.  I'm so weary I don't even notice I'm in the pool until I'm ankle-deep. It's spring-fed, bubbling up out of a crevice in some rocks, and blissfully cool. I plunge my hands into the shallow water and feel instant relief. Isn't that what my mother always says? The first treatment for a burn is cold water? That it draws out the heat? But she means minor burns. Probably she'd recommend it for my hands. But what of my calf? Although I have not yet had the courage to examine it, I'm guessing that it's an injury in a whole different class.  I lie on my stomach at edge of the pool for a while, dangling my hands in the water, examining the little flames on my fingernails that are beginning to chip off. Good. I've had enough fire for a lifetime.  I bathe the blood and ash from my face. I try to recall all I know about burns. They are common injuries in the Seam where we cook and heat our homes with coal. Then there are the mine accidents. A family once brought in an unconscious young man pleading with my mother to help him. The district doctor who's responsible for treating the miners had written him off, told the family to take him home to die. But they wouldn't accept this. He lay on our kitchen table, senseless to the world. I got a glimpse of the wound on his thigh, gaping, charred flesh, burned clear down to the bone, before I ran from the house. I went to the woods and hunted the entire day, haunted by the gruesome leg, memories of my father's death. What's funny was, Prim, who's scared of her own shadow, stayed and helped. My mother says healers are born, not made. They did their best, but the man died, just like the doctor said he would.  My leg is in need of attention, but I still can't look at it. What if it's as bad as the man's and I can see my bone? Then I remember my mother saying that if a burn's severe, the victim might not even feel pain because the nerves would be destroyed. Encouraged by this, I sit up and swing my leg in front of me.  I almost faint at the sight of my calf. The flesh is a brilliant red covered with blisters. I force myself to take deep, slow breaths, feeling quite certain the cameras are on my face. I can't show weakness at this injury. Not if I want help. Pity does not get you aid. Admiration at your refusal to give in does. I cut the remains of the pant leg off at the knee and examine the injury more closely. The burned area is about the size of my hand. None of the skin is blackened. I think it's not too bad to soak. Gingerly I stretch out my leg into the pool, propping the heel of my boot on a rock so the leather doesn't get too sodden, and sigh, because this does offer some relief. I know there are herbs, if I could find them, that would speed the healing, but I can't quite call them to mind. Water and time will probably be all I have to work with.  Should I be moving on? The smoke is slowly clearing but still too heavy to be healthy. If I do continue away from the fire, won't I be walking straight into the weapons of the Careers? Besides, every time I lift my leg from the water, the pain rebounds so intensely I have to slide it back in. My hands are slightly less demanding. They can handle small breaks from the pool. So I slowly put my gear back in order. First I fill my bottle with the pool water, treat it, and when enough time has passed, begin to rehydrate my body. After a time, I force myself to nibble on a cracker, which helps settle my stomach. I roll up my sleeping bag. Except for a few black marks, it's relatively unscathed. My jacket's another matter. Stinking and scorched, at least a foot of the back beyond repair. I cut off the damaged area leaving me with a garment that comes just to the bottom of my ribs. But the hood's intact and it's far better than nothing.  Despite the pain, drowsiness begins to take over. I'd take to a tree and try to rest, except I'd be too easy to spot. Besides, abandoning my pool seems impossible. I neatly arrange my supplies, even settle my pack on my shoulders, but I can't seem to leave. I spot some water plants with edible roots and make a small meal with my last piece of rabbit. Sip water. Watch the sun make its slow arc across the sky. Where would I go anyway that is any safer than here? I lean back on my pack, overcome by drowsiness. If the Careers want me, let them find me, I think before drifting into a stupor. Let them find me.  And find me, they do. It's lucky I'm ready to move on because when I hear the feet, I have less than a minute head start. Evening has begun to fall. The moment I awake, I'm up and running, splashing across the pool, flying into the underbrush. My leg slows me down, but I sense my pursuers are not as speedy as they were before the fire, either. I hear their coughs, their raspy voices calling to one another.  Still, they are closing in, just like a pack of wild dogs, and so I do what I have done my whole life in such circumstances. I pick a high tree and begin to climb. If running hurt, climbing is agonizing because it requires not only exertion but direct contact of my hands on the tree bark. I'm fast, though, and by the time they've reached the base of my trunk, I'm twenty feet up. For a moment, we stop and survey one another. I hope they can't hear the pounding of my heart.  This could be it, I think. What chance do I have against them? All six are there, the five Careers and Peeta, and my only consolation is they're pretty beat-up, too. Even so, look at their weapons. Look at their faces, grinning and snarling at me, a sure kill above them. It seems pretty hopeless. But then something else registers. They're bigger and stronger than I am, no doubt, but they're also heavier. There's a reason it's me and not Gale who ventures up to pluck the highest fruit, or rob the most remote bird nests. I must weigh at least fifty or sixty pounds less than the smallest Career.  Now I smile. ""How's everything with you?"" I call down cheerfully.  This takes them aback, but I know the crowd will love it.  ""Well enough,"" says the boy from District 2. ""Yourself?""  ""It's been a bit warm for my taste,"" I say. I can almost hear the laughter from the Capitol. ""The air's better up here. Why don't you come on up?""  ""Think I will,"" says the same boy.  ""Here, take this, Cato,"" says the girl from District 1, and she offers him the silver bow and sheath of arrows. My bow! My arrows! Just the sight of them makes me so angry I want to scream, at myself, at that traitor Peeta for distracting me from having them. I try to make eye contact with him now, but he seems to be intentionally avoiding my gaze as he polishes his knife with the edge of his shirt.  ""No,"" says Cato, pushing away the bow. ""I'll do better with my sword."" I can see the weapon, a short, heavy blade at his belt.  I give Cato time to hoist himself into the tree before I begin to climb again. Gale always says I remind him of a squirrel the way I can scurry up even the slenderest limb. Part of it's my weight, but part of it's practice. You have to know where to place your hands and feet. I'm another thirty feet in the air when I hear the crack and look down to see Cato flailing as he and a branch go down. He hits the ground hard and I'm hoping he possibly broke his neck when he gets back to his feet, swearing like a fiend.  The girl with the arrows, Glimmer I hear someone call her  -  ugh, the names the people in District 1 give their children are so ridiculous  -  anyway Glimmer scales the tree until the branches begin to crack under her feet and then has the good sense to stop. I'm at least eighty feet high now. She tries to shoot me and it's immediately evident that she's incompetent with a bow. One of the arrows gets lodged in the tree near me though and I'm able to seize it. I wave it teasingly above her head, as if this was the sole purpose of retrieving it, when actually I mean to use it if I ever get the chance. I could kill them, everyone of them, if those silver weapons were in my hands.  The Careers regroup on the ground and I can hear them growling conspiratorially among themselves, furious I have made them look foolish. But twilight has arrived and their window of attack on me is closing. Finally, I hear Peeta say harshly, ""Oh, let her stay up there. It's not like she's going anywhere. We'll deal with her in the morning.""  Well, he's right about one thing. I'm going nowhere. All the relief from the pool water has gone, leaving me to feel the full potency of my burns. I scoot down to a fork in the tree and clumsily prepare for bed. Put on my jacket. Lay out my sleeping bed. Belt myself in and try to keep from moaning. The heat of the bag's too much for my leg. I cut a slash in the fabric and hang my calf out in the open air. I drizzle water on the wound, my hands.  All my bravado is gone. I'm weak from pain and hunger but can't bring myself to eat. Even if I can last the night, what will the morning bring? I stare into the foliage trying to will myself to rest, but the burns forbid it. Birds are settling down for the night, singing lullabies to their young. Night creatures emerge. An owl hoots. The faint scent of a skunk cuts through the smoke. The eyes of some animal peer at me from the neighboring tree  -  a possum maybe  -  catching the firelight from the Careers' torches. Suddenly, I'm up on one elbow. Those are no possum's eyes, I know their glassy reflection too well. In fact, those are not animal eyes at all. In the last dim rays of light, I make her out, watching me silently from between the branches. Rue.  How long has she been here? The whole time probably. Still and unobserved as the action unfolded beneath her. Perhaps she headed up her tree shortly before I did, hearing the pack was so close.  For a while we hold each other's gaze. Then, without even rustling a leaf, her little hand slides into the open and points to something above my head."
Hunger Games Chapter 14,"My eyes follow the line of her finger up into the foliage above me. At first, I have no idea what she's pointing to, but then, about fifteen feet up, I make out the vague shape in the dimming light. But of. of what? Some sort of animal? It looks about the size of a raccoon, but it hangs from the bottom of a branch, swaying ever so slightly. There's something else. Among the familiar evening sounds of the woods, my ears register a low hum. Then I know. It's a wasp nest.  Fear shoots through me, but I have enough sense to keep still. After all, I don't know what kind of wasp lives there. It could be the ordinary leave-us-alone-and-we'll-leave-you-alone type. But these are the Hunger Games, and ordinary isn't the norm. More likely they will be one of the Capitol's muttations, tracker jackers. Like the jabberjays, these killer wasps were spawned in a lab and strategically placed, like land mines, around the districts during the war. Larger than regular wasps, they have a distinctive solid gold body and a sting that raises a lump the size of a plum on contact. Most people can't tolerate more than a few stings. Some die at once. If you live, the hallucinations brought on by the venom have actually driven people to madness. And there's another thing, these wasps will hunt down anyone who disturbs their nest and attempt to kill them. That's where the tracker part of the name comes from.  After the war, the Capitol destroyed all the nests surrounding their city, but the ones near the districts were left untouched. Another reminder of our weakness, I suppose, just like the Hunger Games. Another reason to keep inside the fence of District 12. When Gale and I come across a tracker jacker nest, we immediately head in the opposite direction.  So is that what hangs above me? I look back to Rue for help, but she's melted into her tree.  Given my circumstances, I guess it doesn't matter what type of wasp nest it is. I'm wounded and trapped. Darkness has given me a brief reprieve, but by the time the sun rises, the Careers will have formulated a plan to kill me. There's no way they could do otherwise after I've made them look so stupid. That nest may be the sole option I have left. If I can drop it down on them, I may be able to escape. But I'll risk my life in the process.  Of course, I'll never be able to get in close enough to the actual nest to cut it free. I'll have to saw off the branch at the trunk and send the whole thing down. The serrated portion of my knife should be able to manage that. But can my hands? And will the vibration from the sawing raise the swarm? And what if the Careers figure out what I'm doing and move their camp? That would defeat the whole purpose.  I realize that the best chance I'll have to do the sawing without drawing notice will be during the anthem. That could begin any time. I drag myself out of my bag, make sure my knife is secured in my belt, and begin to make my way up the tree. This in itself is dangerous since the branches are becoming precariously thin even for me, but I persevere. When I reach the limb that supports the nest, the humming becomes more distinctive. But it's still oddly subdued if these are tracker jackers. It's the smoke, I think. It's sedated them. This was the one defense the rebels found to battle the wasps.  The seal of the Capitol shines above me and the anthem blares out. It's now or never, I think, and begin to saw. Blisters burst on my right hand as I awkwardly drag the knife back and forth. Once I've got a groove, the work requires less effort but is almost more than I can handle. I grit my teeth and saw away occasionally glancing at the sky to register that there were no deaths today. That's all right. The audience will be sated seeing me injured and treed and the pack below me. But the anthem's running out and I'm only three quarters of the way through the wood when the music ends, the sky goes dark, and I'm forced to stop.  Now what? I could probably finish off the job by sense of feel but that may not be the smartest plan. If the wasps are too groggy, if the nest catches on its way down, if I try to escape, this could all be a deadly waste of time. Better, I think, to sneak up here at dawn and send the nest into my enemies.  In the faint light of the Careers' torches, I inch back down to my fork to find the best surprise I've ever had. Sitting on my sleeping bag is a small plastic pot attached to a silver parachute. My first gift from a sponsor! Haymitch must have had it sent in during the anthem. The pot easily fits in the palm of my hand. What can it be? Not food surely. I unscrew the lid and I know by the scent that it's medicine. Cautiously, I probe the surface of the ointment. The throbbing in my fingertip vanishes.  ""Oh, Haymitch,"" I whisper. ""Thank you."" He has not abandoned me. Not left me to fend entirely for myself. The cost of this medicine must be astronomical. Probably not one but many sponsors have contributed to buy this one tiny pot. To me, it is priceless.  I dip two fingers in the jar and gently spread the balm over my calf. The effect is almost magical, erasing the pain on contact, leaving a pleasant cooling sensation behind. This is no herbal concoction that my mother grinds up out of woodland plants, it's high-tech medicine brewed up in the Capitol's labs. When my calf is treated, I rub a thin layer into my hands. After wrapping the pot in the parachute, I nestle it safely away in my pack. Now that the pain has eased, it's all I can do to reposition myself in my bag before I plunge into sleep.  A bird perched just a few feet from me alerts me that a new day is dawning. In the gray morning light, I examine my hands. The medicine has transformed all the angry red patches to a soft baby-skin pink. My leg still feels inflamed, but that burn was far deeper. I apply another coat of medicine and quietly pack up my gear. Whatever happens, I'm going to have to move and move fast. I also make myself eat a cracker and a strip of beef and drink a few cups of water.  Almost nothing stayed in my stomach yesterday, and I'm already starting to feel the effects of hunger.  Below me, I can see the Career pack and Peeta asleep on the ground. By her position, leaning up against the trunk of the tree, I'd guess Glimmer was supposed to be on guard, but fatigue overcame her.  My eyes squint as they try to penetrate the tree next to me, but I can't make out Rue. Since she tipped me off, it only seems fair to warn her. Besides, if I'm going to die today, it's Rue I want to win. Even if it means a little extra food for my family, the idea of Peeta being crowned victor is unbearable.  I call Rue's name in a hushed whisper and the eyes appear, wide and alert, at once. She points up to the nest again. I hold up my knife and make a sawing motion. She nods and disappears. There's a rustling in a nearby tree. Then the same noise again a bit farther off. I realize she's leaping from tree to tree. It's all I can do not to laugh out loud. Is this what she showed the Gamemakers? I imagine her flying around the training equipment never touching the floor. She should have gotten at least a ten.  Rosy streaks are breaking through in the east. I can't afford to wait any longer. Compared to the agony of last night's climb, this one is a cinch. At the tree limb that holds the nest, I position the knife in the groove and I'm about to draw the teeth across the wood when I see something moving. There, on the nest. The bright gold gleam of a tracker jacker lazily making its way across the papery gray surface. No question, it's acting a little subdued, but the wasp is up and moving and that means the others will be out soon as well. Sweat breaks out on the palms of my hands, beading up through the ointment, and I do my best to pat them dry on my shirt. If I don't get through this branch in a matter of seconds, the entire swarm could emerge and attack me.  There's no sense in putting it off. I take a deep breath, grip the knife handle and bear down as hard as I can. Back, forth, back, forth! The tracker jackers begin to buzz and I hear them coming out. Back, forth, back, forth! A stabbing pain shoots through my knee and I know one has found me and the others will be honing in. Back, forth, back, forth. And just as the knife cuts through, I shove the end of the branch as far away from me as I can. It crashes down through the lower branches, snagging temporarily on a few but then twisting free until it smashes with a thud on the ground. The nest bursts open like an egg, and a furious swarm of tracker jackers takes to the air.  I feel a second sting on the cheek, a third on my neck, and their venom almost immediately makes me woozy. I cling to the tree with one arm while I rip the barbed stingers out of my flesh. Fortunately, only these three tracker jackers had identified me before the nest went down. The rest of the insects have targeted their enemies on the ground.  It's mayhem. The Careers have woken to a full-scale tracker jacker attack. Peeta and a few others have the sense to drop everything and bolt. I can hear cries of ""To the lake! To the lake!"" and know they hope to evade the wasps by taking to the water. It must be close if they think they can outdistance the furious insects. Glimmer and another girl, the one from District 4, are not so lucky. They receive multiple stings before they're even out of my view. Glimmer appears to go completely mad, shrieking and trying to bat the wasps off with her bow, which is pointless. She calls to the others for help but, of course, no one returns. The girl from District 4 staggers out of sight, although I wouldn't bet on her making it to the lake. I watch Glimmer fall, twitch hysterically around on the ground for a few minutes, and then go still.  The nest is nothing but an empty shell. The wasps have vanished in pursuit of the others. I don't think they'll return, but I don't want to risk it. I scamper down the tree and hit the ground running in the opposite direction of the lake. The poison from the stingers makes me wobbly, but I find my way back to my own little pool and submerge myself in the water, just in case any wasps are still on my trail. After about five minutes, I drag myself onto the rocks. People have not exaggerated the effects of the tracker jacker stings. Actually, the one on my knee is closer to an orange than a plum in size. A foul-smelling green liquid oozes from the places where I pulled out the stingers.  The swelling. The pain. The ooze. Watching Glimmer twitching to death on the ground. It's a lot to handle before the sun has even cleared the horizon. I don't want to think about what Glimmer must look like now. Her body disfigured. Her swollen fingers stiffening around the bow.  The bow! Somewhere in my befuddled mind one thought connects to another and I'm on my feet, teetering through the trees back to Glimmer. The bow. The arrows. I must get them. I haven't heard the cannons fire yet, so perhaps Glimmer is in some sort of coma, her heart still struggling against the wasp venom. But once it stops and the cannon signals her death, a hovercraft will move in and retrieve her body, taking the only bow and sheath of arrows I've seen out of the Games for good. And I refuse to let them slip through my fingers again!  I reach Glimmer just as the cannon fires. The tracker jackers have vanished. This girl, so breathtakingly beautiful in her golden dress the night of the interviews, is unrecognizable. Her features eradicated, her limbs three times their normal size. The stinger lumps have begun to explode, spewing putrid green liquid around her. I have to break several of what used to be her fingers with a stone to free the bow. The sheath of arrows is pinned under her back. I try to roll over her body by pulling on one arm, but the flesh disintegrates in my hands and I fall back on the ground.  Is this real? Or have the hallucinations begun? I squeeze my eyes tight and try to breathe through my mouth, ordering myself not to become sick. Breakfast must stay down, it might be days before I can hunt again. A second cannon fires and I'm guessing the girl from District 4 has just died. I hear the birds fall silent and then one give the warning call, which means a hovercraft is about to appear. Confused, I think it's for Glimmer, although this doesn't quite make sense because I'm still in the picture, still fighting for the arrows. I lurch back onto my knees and the trees around me begin to spin in circles. In the middle of the sky, I spot the hovercraft. I throw myself over Glimmer's body as if to protect it but then I see the girl from District 4 being lifted into the air and vanishing.  ""Do this!"" I command myself. Clenching my jaw, I dig my hands under Glimmer's body, get a hold on what must be her rib cage, and force her onto her stomach. I can't help it, I'm hyperventilating now, the whole thing is so nightmarish and I'm losing my grasp on what's real. I tug on the silver sheath of arrows, but it's caught on something, her shoulder blade, something, and finally yank it free. I've just encircled the sheath with my arms when I hear the footsteps, several pairs, coming through the underbrush, and I realize the Careers have come back. They've come back to kill me or get their weapons or both.  But it's too late to run. I pull a slimy arrow from the sheath and try to position it on the bowstring but instead of one string I see three and the stench from the stings is so repulsive I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't do it.  I'm helpless as the first hunter crashes through the trees, spear lifted, poised to throw. The shock on Peeta's face makes no sense to me. I wait for the blow. Instead his arm drops to his side.  ""What are you still doing here?"" he hisses at me. I stare uncomprehendingly as a trickle of water drips off a sting under his ear. His whole body starts sparkling as if he's been dipped in dew. ""Are you mad?"" He's prodding me with the shaft of the spear now. ""Get up! Get up!"" I rise, but he's still pushing at me. What? What is going on? He shoves me away from him hard. ""Run!"" he screams. ""Run!""  Behind him, Cato slashes his way through the brush. He's sparkling wet, too, and badly stung under one eye. I catch the gleam of sunlight on his sword and do as Peeta says. Holding tightly to my bow and arrows, banging into trees that appear out of nowhere, tripping and falling as I try to keep my balance. Back past my pool and into unfamiliar woods. The world begins to bend in alarming ways. A butterfly balloons to the size of a house then shatters into a million stars. Trees transform to blood and splash down over my boots. Ants begin to crawl out of the blisters on my hands and I can't shake them free. They're climbing up my arms, my neck. Someone's screaming, a long high pitched scream that never breaks for breath. I have a vague idea it might be me. I trip and fall into a small pit lined with tiny orange bubbles that hum like the tracker jacker nest. Tucking my knees up to my chin, I wait for death.  Sick and disoriented, I'm able to form only one thought: Peeta Mellark just saved my life.  Then the ants bore into my eyes and I black out."
Hunger Games Chapter 15,"I enter a nightmare from which I wake repeatedly only to find a greater terror awaiting me. All the things I dread most, all the things I dread for others manifest in such vivid detail I can't help but believe they're real. Each time I wake, I think, At last, this is over, but it isn't. It's only the beginning of a new chapter of torture. How many ways do I watch Prim die? Relive my father's last moments? Feel my own body ripped apart? This is the nature of the tracker jacker venom, so carefully created to target the place where fear lives in your brain.  When I finally do come to my senses, I lie still, waiting for the next onslaught of imagery. But eventually I accept that the poison must have finally worked its way out of my system, leaving my body wracked and feeble. I'm still lying on my side, locked in the fetal position. I lift a hand to my eyes to find them sound, untouched by ants that never existed. Simply stretching out my limbs requires an enormous effort. So many parts of me hurt, it doesn't seem worthwhile taking inventory of them. Very, very slowly I manage to sit up. I'm in a shallow hole, not filled with the humming orange bubbles of my hallucination but with old, dead leaves. My clothing's damp, but I don't know whether pond water, dew, rain, or sweat is the cause. For a long time, all I can do is take tiny sips from my bottle and watch a beetle crawl up the side of a honeysuckle bush.  How long have I been out? It was morning when I lost reason. Now it's afternoon. But the stiffness in my joints suggests more than a day has passed, even two possibly. If so, I'll have no way of knowing which tributes survived that tracker jacker attack. Not Glimmer or the girl from District 4. But there was the boy from District 1, both tributes from District 2, and Peeta. Did they die from the stings? Certainly if they lived, their last days must have been as horrid as my own. And what about Rue? She's so small, it wouldn't take much venom to do her in. But then again. the tracker jackers would've had to catch her, and she had a good head start.  A foul, rotten taste pervades my mouth, and the water has little effect on it. I drag myself over to the honeysuckle bush and pluck a flower. I gently pull the stamen through the blossom and set the drop of nectar on my tongue. The sweetness spreads through my mouth, down my throat, warming my veins with memories of summer, and my home woods and Gale's presence beside me. For some reason, our discussion from that last morning comes back to me.  ""We could do it, you know.""  ""What?""  ""Leave the district. Run off. Live in the woods. You and I, we could make it.""  And suddenly, I'm not thinking of Gale but of Peeta and. Peeta! He saved my life! I think. Because by the time we met up, I couldn't tell what was real and what the tracker jacker venom had caused me to imagine. But if he did, and my instincts tell me he did, what for? Is he simply working the Lover Boy angle he initiated at the interview? Or was he actually trying to protect me? And if he was, what was he doing with those Careers in the first place? None of it makes sense.  I wonder what Gale made of the incident for a moment and then I push the whole thing out of my mind because for some reason Gale and Peeta do not coexist well together in my thoughts.  So I focus on the one really good thing that's happened since I landed in the arena. I have a bow and arrows! A full dozen arrows if you count the one I retrieved in the tree. They bear no trace of the noxious green slime that came from Glimmer's body  -  which leads me to believe that might not have been wholly real  -  but they have a fair amount of dried blood on them. I can clean them later, but I do take a minute to shoot a few into a nearby tree. They are more like the weapons in the Training Center than my ones at home, but who cares? That I can work with.  The weapons give me an entirely new perspective on the Games. I know I have tough opponents left to face. But I am no longer merely prey that runs and hides or takes desperate measures. If Cato broke through the trees right now, I wouldn't flee, I'd shoot. I find I'm actually anticipating the moment with pleasure.  But first, I have to get some strength back in my body. I'm very dehydrated again and my water supply is dangerously low. The little padding I was able to put on by gorging myself during prep time in the Capitol is gone, plus several more pounds as well. My hip bones and ribs are more prominent than I remember them being since those awful months after my father's death. And then there are my wounds to contend with  -  burns, cuts, and bruises from smashing into the trees, and three tracker jacker stings, which are as sore and swollen as ever. I treat my burns with the ointment and try dabbing a bit on my stings as well, but it has no effect on them. My mother knew a treatment for them, some type of leaf that could draw out the poison, but she seldom had cause to use it, and I don't even remember its name let alone its appearance.  Water first, I think. You can hunt along the way now. It's easy to see the direction I came from by the path of destruction my crazed body made through the foliage. So I walk off in the other direction, hoping my enemies still lie locked in the surreal world of tracker jacker venom.  I can't move too quickly, my joints reject any abrupt motions. But I establish the slow hunter's tread I use when tracking game. Within a few minutes, I spot a rabbit and make my first kill with the bow and arrow. It's not my usual clean shot through the eye, but I'll take it. After about an hour, I find a stream, shallow but wide, and more than sufficient for my needs. The sun's hot and severe, so while I wait for my water to purify I strip down to my underclothes and wade into the mild current. I'm filthy from head to toe, I try splashing myself but eventually just lay down in the water for a few minutes, letting it wash off the soot and blood and skin that has started to peel off my burns. After rinsing out my clothes and hanging them on bushes to dry, I sit on the bank in the sun for a bit, untangling my hair with my fingers. My appetite returns and I eat a cracker and a strip of beef. With a handful of moss, I polish the blood from my silver weapons.  Refreshed, I treat my burns again, braid back my hair, and dress in the damp clothes, knowing the sun will dry them soon enough. Following the stream against its current seems the smartest course of action. I'm traveling uphill now, which I prefer, with a source of fresh water not only for myself but possible game. I easily take out a strange bird that must be some form of wild turkey. Anyway, it looks plenty edible to me. By late afternoon, I decide to build a small fire to cook the meat, betting that dusk will help conceal the smoke and I can quench the fire by nightfall. I clean the game, taking extra care with the bird, but there's nothing alarming about it. Once the feathers are plucked, it's no bigger than a chicken, but it's plump and firm. I've just placed the first lot over the coals when I hear the twig snap.  In one motion, I turn to the sound, bringing the bow and arrow to my shoulder. There's no one there. No one I can see anyway. Then I spot the tip of a child's boot just peeking out from behind the trunk of a tree. My shoulders relax and I grin. She can move through the woods like a shadow, you have to give her that. How else could she have followed me? The words come out of my mouth before I can stop them.  ""You know, they're not the only ones who can form alliances,"" I say.  For a moment, no response. Then one of Rue's eyes edges around the trunk. ""You want me for an ally?""  ""Why not? You saved me with those tracker jackers. You're smart enough to still be alive. And I can't seem to shake you anyway,"" I say. She blinks at me, trying to decide. ""You hungry?"" I can see her swallow hard, her eye flickering to the meat. ""Come on then, I've had two kills today.""  Rue tentatively steps out into the open. ""I can fix your stings.""  ""Can you?"" I ask. ""How?""  She digs in the pack she carries and pulls out a handful of leaves. I'm almost certain they're the ones my mother uses. ""Where'd you find those?""  ""Just around. We all carry them when we work in the orchards. They left a lot of nests there,"" says Rue. ""There are a lot here, too.""  ""That's right. You're District Eleven. Agriculture,"" I say. ""Orchards, huh? That must be how you can fly around the trees like you've got wings."" Rue smiles. I've landed on one of the few things she'll admit pride in. ""Well, come on, then. Fix me up.""  I plunk down by the fire and roll up my pant leg to reveal the sting on my knee. To my surprise, Rue places the handful of leaves into her mouth and begins to chew them. My mother would use other methods, but it's not like we have a lot of options. After a minute or so, Rue presses a gloppy green wad of chewed leaves and spit on my knee.  ""Ohhh."" The sound comes out of my mouth before I can stop it. It's as if the leaves are actually leaching the pain right out of the sting.  Rue gives a giggle. ""Lucky you had the sense to pull the stingers out or you'd be a lot worse.""  ""Do my neck! Do my cheek!"" I almost beg.  Rue stuffs another handful of leaves in her mouth, and soon I'm laughing because the relief is so sweet. I notice a long burn on Rue's forearm. ""I've got something for that."" I set aside my weapons and anoint her arm with the burn medicine.  ""You have good sponsors,"" she says longingly.  ""Have you gotten anything yet?"" I ask. She shakes her head. ""You will, though. Watch. The closer we get to the end, the more people will realize how clever you are."" I turn the meat over.  ""You weren't joking, about wanting me for an ally?"" she asks.  ""No, I meant it,"" I say. I can almost hear Haymitch groaning as I team up with this wispy child. But I want her. Because she's a survivor, and I trust her, and why not admit it? She reminds me of Prim.  ""Okay,"" she says, and holds out her hand. We shake. ""It's a deal.""  Of course, this kind of deal can only be temporary, but neither of us mentions that.  Rue contributes a big handful of some sort of starchy root to the meal. Roasted over the fire, they have the sharp sweet taste of a parsnip. She recognizes the bird, too, some wild thing they call a groosling in her district. She says sometimes a flock will wander into the orchard and they get a decent lunch that day. For a while, all conversation stops as we fill our stomachs. The groosling has delicious meal that's so fatty, the grease drips down your face when you bite into it.  ""Oh,"" says Rue with a sigh. ""I've never had a whole leg to myself before.""  I'll bet she hasn't. I'll bet meat hardly ever comes her way. ""Take the other,"" I say.  ""Really?"" she asks.  ""Take whatever you want. Now that I've got a bow and arrows, I can get more. Plus I've got snares. I can show you how to set them,"" I say. Rue still looks uncertainly at the leg. ""Oh, take it,"" I say, putting the drumstick in her hands. ""It will only keep a few days anyway, and we've got the whole bird plus the rabbit."" Once she's got hold of it, her appetite wins out and she takes a huge mouthful.  ""I'd have thought, in District Eleven, you'd have a bit more to eat than us. You know, since you grow the food,"" I say.  Rue's eyes widen. ""Oh, no, we're not allowed to eat the crops.""  ""They arrest you or something?"" I ask.  ""They whip you and make everyone else watch,"" says Rue. ""The mayor's very strict about it.""  I can tell by her expression that it's not that uncommon an occurrence. A public whipping's a rare thing in District 12, although occasionally one occurs. Technically, Gale and I could be whipped on a daily basis for poaching in the woods  -  well, technically, we could get a whole lot worse  -  except all the officials buy our meat. Besides, our mayor, Madge's father, doesn't seem to have much taste for such events. Maybe being the least prestigious, poorest, most ridiculed district in the country has its advantages. Such as, being largely ignored by the Capitol as long as we produce our coal quotas.  ""Do you get all the coal you want?"" Rue asks.  ""No,"" I answer. ""Just what we buy and whatever we track in on our boots.""  ""They feed us a bit extra during harvest, so that people can keep going longer,"" says Rue.  ""Don't you have to be in school?"" I ask.  ""Not during harvest. Everyone works then,"" says Rue.  It's interesting, hearing about her life. We have so little communication with anyone outside our district. In fact, I wonder if the Gamemakers are blocking out our conversation, because even though the information seems harmless, they don't want people in different districts to know about one another.  At Rue's suggestion, we lay out all our food to plan ahead. She's seen most of mine, but I add the last couple of crackers and beef strips to the pile. She's gathered quite a collection of roots, nuts, greens, and even some berries.  I roll an unfamiliar berry in my fingers. ""You sure this is safe?""  ""Oh, yes, we have them back home. I've been eating them for days,"" she says, popping a handful in her mouth. I tentatively bite into one, and it's as good as our blackberries. Taking Rue on as an ally seems a better choice all the time. We divide up our food supplies, so in case we're separated, we'll both be set for a few days. Apart from the food, Rue has a small water skin, a homemade slingshot, and an extra pair of socks. She also has a sharp shard of rock she uses as a knife. ""I know it's not much,"" she says as if embarrassed, ""but I had to get away from the Cornucopia fast.""  ""You did just right,"" I say. When I spread out my gear, she gasps a little when she sees the sunglasses.  ""How did you get those?"" she asks.  ""In my pack. They've been useless so far. They don't block the sun and they make it harder to see,"" I say with a shrug.  ""These aren't for sun, they're for darkness,"" exclaims Rue. ""Sometimes, when we harvest through the night, they'll pass out a few pairs to those of us highest in the trees. Where the torchlight doesn't reach. One time, this boy Martin, he tried to keep his pair. Hid it in his pants. They killed him on the spot.""  ""They killed a boy for taking these?"" I say.  ""Yes, and everyone knew he was no danger. Martin wasn't right in the head. I mean, he still acted like a three-year-old. He just wanted the glasses to play with,"" says Rue.  Hearing this makes me feel like District 12 is some sort of safe haven. Of course, people keel over from starvation all the time, but I can't imagine the Peacekeepers murdering a simpleminded child. There's a little girl, one of Greasy Sae's grandkids, who wanders around the Hob. She's not quite right, but she's treated as a sort of pet. People toss her scraps and things.  ""So what do these do?"" I ask Rue, taking the glasses.  ""They let you see in complete darkness,"" says Rue. ""Try them tonight when the sun goes down.""  I give Rue some matches and she makes sure I have plenty of leaves in case my stings flare up again. We extinguish our fire and head upstream until it's almost nightfall.  ""Where do you sleep?"" I ask her. ""In the trees?"" She nods. ""In just your jacket?""  Rue holds up her extra pair of socks. ""I have these for my hands.""  I think of how cold the nights have been. ""You can share my sleeping bag if you want. We'll both easily fit."" Her face lights up. I can tell this is more than she dared hope for.  We pick a fork high in a tree and settle in for the night just as the anthem begins to play. There were no deaths today.  ""Rue, I only woke up today. How many nights did I miss?"" The anthem should block out our words, but still I whisper. I even take the precaution of covering my lips with my hand. I don't want the audience to know what I'm planning to tell her about Peeta. Taking a cue from me, she does the same.  ""Two,"" she says. ""The girls from Districts One and Four are dead. There's ten of us left.""  ""Something strange happened. At least, I think it did. It might have been the tracker jacker venom making me imagine things,"" I say. ""You know the boy from my district? Peeta? I think he saved my life. But he was with the Careers.""  ""He's not with them now,"" she says. ""I've spied on their base camp by the lake. They made it back before they collapsed from the stingers. But he's not there. Maybe he did save you and had to run.""  I don't answer. If, in fact, Peeta did save me, I'm in his debt again. And this can't be paid back. ""If he did, it was all probably just part of his act. You know, to make people think he's in love with me.""  ""Oh,"" says Rue thoughtfully. ""I didn't think that was an act.""  ""Course it is,"" I say. ""He worked it out with our mentor."" The anthem ends and the sky goes dark. ""Let's try out these glasses."" I pull out the glasses and slip them on. Rue wasn't kidding. I can see everything from the leaves on the trees to a skunk strolling through the bushes a good fifty feet away. I could kill it from here if I had a mind to. I could kill anyone.  ""I wonder who else got a pair of these,"" I say.  ""The Careers have two pairs. But they've got everything down by the lake,"" Rue says. ""And they're so strong.""  ""We're strong, too,"" I say. ""Just in a different way.""  ""You are. You can shoot,"" she says. ""What can I do?""  ""You can feed yourself. Can they?"" I ask.  ""They don't need to. They have all those supplies,"" Rue says.  ""Say they didn't. Say the supplies were gone. How long would they last?"" I say. ""I mean, it's the Hunger Games, right?""  ""But, Katniss, they're not hungry,"" says Rue.  ""No, they're not. That's the problem,"" I agree. And for the first time, I have a plan. A plan that isn't motivated by the need for flight and evasion. An offensive plan. ""I think we're going to have to fix that, Rue."""
Hunger Games Chapter 16,"Rue has decided to trust me wholeheartedly. I know this because as soon as the anthem finishes she snuggles up against me and falls asleep. Nor do I have any misgivings about her, as I take no particular precautions. If she'd wanted me dead, all she would have had to do was disappear from that tree without pointing out the tracker jacker nest. Needling me, at the very back of my mind, is the obvious. Both of us can't win these Games. But since the odds are still against either of us surviving, I manage to ignore the thought.  Besides, I'm distracted by my latest idea about the Careers and their supplies. Somehow Rue and I must find a way to destroy their food. I'm pretty sure feeding themselves will be a tremendous struggle. Traditionally, the Career tributes' strategy is to get hold of all the food early on and work from there. The years when they have not protected it well  -  one year a pack of hideous reptiles destroyed it, another a Gamemakers' flood washed it away  -  those are usually the years that tributes from other districts have won. That the Careers have been better red growing up is actually to their disadvantage, because they don't know how to be hungry. Not the way Rue and I do.  But I'm too exhausted to begin any detailed plan tonight. My wounds recovering, my mind still a bit foggy from the venom, and the warmth of Rue at my side, her head cradled on my shoulder, have given me a sense of security. I realize, for the first time, how very lonely I've been in the arena. How comforting the presence of another human being can be. I give in to my drowsiness, resolving that tomorrow the tables will turn. Tomorrow, it's the Careers who will have to watch their backs.  The boom of the cannon jolts me awake. The sky's streaked with light, the birds already chattering. Rue perches in a branch across from me, her hands cupping something. We wait, listening for more shots, but there aren't any.  ""Who do you think that was?"" I can't help thinking of Peeta.  ""I don't know. It could have been any of the others,"" says Rue. ""I guess we'll know tonight.""  ""Who's left again?"" I ask.  ""The boy from District One. Both tributes from Two. The boy from Three. Thresh and me. And you and Peeta,"" says Rue. ""That's eight. Wait, and the boy from Ten, the one with the bad leg. He makes nine.""  There's someone else, but neither of us can remember who it is.  ""I wonder how that last one died,"" says Rue.  ""No telling. But it's good for us. A death should hold the crowd for a bit. Maybe we'll have time to do something before the Gamemakers decide things have been moving too slowly,"" I say. ""What's in your hands?""  ""Breakfast,"" says Rue. She holds them out revealing two big eggs.  ""What kind are those?"" I ask.  ""Not sure. There's a marshy area over that way. Some kind of waterbird,"" she says.  It'd be nice to cook them, but neither of us wants to risk a fire. My guess is the tribute who died today was a victim of the Careers, which means they've recovered enough to be back in the Games. We each suck out the insides of an egg, eat a rabbit leg and some berries. It's a good breakfast anywhere.  ""Ready to do it?"" I say, pulling on my pack.  ""Do what?"" says Rue, but by the way she bounces up, you can tell she's up for whatever I propose.  ""Today we take out the Careers' food,"" I say.  ""Really? How?"" You can see the glint of excitement in her eyes. In this way, she's exactly the opposite of Prim for whom adventures are an ordeal.  ""No idea. Come on, we'll figure out a plan while we hunt,"" I say.  We don't get much hunting done though because I'm too busy getting every scrap of information I can out of Rue about the Careers' base. She's only been in to spy on them briefly, but she's observant. They have set up their camp beside the lake. Their supply stash is about thirty yards away. During the day, they've been leaving another tribute, the boy from District 3, to watch over the supplies.  ""The boy from District Three?"" I ask. ""He's working with them?""  ""Yes, he stays at the camp full-time. He got stung, too, when they drew the tracker jackers in by the lake,"" says Rue. ""I guess they agreed to let him live if he acted as their guard. But he's not very big.""  ""What weapons does he have?"" I ask.  ""Not much that I could see. A spear. He might be able to hold a few of us off with that, but Thresh could kill him easily,"" says Rue.  ""And the food's just out in the open?"" I say. She nods. ""Something's not quite right about that whole setup.""  ""I know. But I couldn't tell what exactly,"" says Rue. ""Katniss, even if you could get to the food, how would you get rid of it?""  ""Burn it. Dump it in the lake. Soak it in fuel."" I poke Rue in the belly, just like I would Prim. ""Eat it!"" She giggles. ""Don't worry, I'll think of something. Destroying things is much easier than making them.""  For a while, we dig roots, we gather berries and greens, we devise a strategy in hushed voices. And I come to know Rue, the oldest of six kids, fiercely protective of her siblings, who gives her rations to the younger ones, who forages in the meadows in a district where the Peacekeepers are far less obliging than ours. Rue, who when you ask her what she loves most in the world, replies, of all things, ""Music.""  ""Music?"" I say. In our world, I rank music somewhere between hair ribbons and rainbows in terms of usefulness. At least a rainbow gives you a tip about the weather. ""You have a lot of time for that?""  ""We sing at home. At work, too. That's why I love your pin,"" she says, pointing to the mockingjay that I've again forgotten about.  ""You have mockingjays?"" I ask.  ""Oh, yes. I have a few that are my special friends. We can sing back and forth for hours. They carry messages for me,"" she says.  ""What do you mean?"" I say.  ""I'm usually up highest, so I'm the first to see the flag that signals quitting time. There's a special little song I do,"" says Rue. She opens her mouth and sings a little four-note run in a sweet, clear voice. ""And the mockingjays spread it around the orchard. That's how everyone knows to knock off,"" she continues. ""They can be dangerous though, if you get too near their nests. But you can't blame them for that.""  I unclasp the pin and hold it out to her. ""Here, you take it. It has more meaning for you than me.""  ""Oh, no,"" says Rue, closing my fingers back over the pin. ""I like to see it on you. That's how I decided I could trust you. Besides, I have this."" She pulls a necklace woven out of some kind of grass from her shirt. On it, hangs a roughly carved wooden star. Or maybe it's a flower. ""It's a good luck charm.""  ""Well, it's worked so far,"" I say, pinning the mockingjay back on my shirt. ""Maybe you should just stick with that.""  By lunch, we have a plan. By early afternoon, we are poised to carry it out. I help Rue collect and place the wood for the first two campfires, the third she'll have time for on her own. We decide to meet afterward at the site where we ate our first meal together. The stream should help guide me back to it. Before I leave, I make sure Rue's well stocked with food and matches. I even insist she take my sleeping bag, in case it's not possible to rendezvous by nightfall.  ""What about you? Won't you be cold?"" she asks.  ""Not if I pick up another bag down by the lake,"" I say. ""You know, stealing isn't illegal here,"" I say with a grin.  At the last minute, Rue decides to teach me her mockingjay signal, the one she gives to indicate the day's work is done. ""It might not work. But if you hear the mockingjays singing it, you'll know I'm okay, only I can't get back right away.""  ""Are there many mockingjays here?"" I ask.  ""Haven't you seen them? They've got nests everywhere,"" she says. I have to admit I haven't noticed.  ""Okay, then. If all goes according to plan, I'll see you for dinner,"" I say.  Unexpectedly, Rue throws her arms around me. I only hesitate a moment before I hug her back.  ""You be careful,"" she says to me.  ""You, too,"" I say. I turn and head back to the stream, feeling somehow worried. About Rue being killed, about Rue not being killed and the two of us being left for last, about leaving Rue alone, about leaving Prim alone back home. No, Prim has my mother and Gale and a baker who has promised she won't go hungry. Rue has only me.  Once I reach the stream, I have only to follow it downhill to the place I initially picked it up after the tracker jacker attack. I have to be cautious as I move along the water though, because I find my thoughts preoccupied with unanswered questions, most of which concern Peeta. The cannon that fired early this morning, did that signify his death? If so, how did he die? At the hand of a Career? And was that in revenge for letting me live? I struggle again to remember that moment over Glimmer's body, when he burst through the trees. But just the fact that he was sparkling leads me to doubt everything that happened.  I must have been moving very slowly yesterday because I reach the shallow stretch where I took my bath in just a few hours. I stop to replenish my water and add a layer of mud to my backpack. It seems bent on reverting to orange no matter how many times I cover it.  My proximity to the Careers' camp sharpens my senses, and the closer I get to them, the more guarded I am, pausing frequently to listen for unnatural sounds, an arrow already fitted into the string of my bow. I don't see any other tributes, but I do notice some of the things Rue has mentioned. Patches of the sweet berries. A bush with the leaves that healed my stings. Clusters of tracker jacker nests in the vicinity of the tree I was trapped in. And here and there, the black-and-white flash of a mockingjay wing in the branches high over my head.  When I reach the tree with the abandoned nest at the foot, I pause a moment, to gather my courage. Rue has given specific instructions on how to reach the best spying place near the lake from this point. Remember, I tell myself. You're the hunter now, not them. I get a firmer grasp on my bow and go on. I make it to the copse Rue has told me about and again have to admire her cleverness. It's right at the edge of the wood, but the bushy foliage is so thick down low I can easily observe the Career camp without being spotted. Between us lies the flat expanse where the Games began.  There are four tributes. The boy from District 1, Cato and the girl from District 2, and a scrawny, ashen-skinned boy who must be from District 3. He made almost no impression on me at all during our time in the Capitol. I can remember almost nothing about him, not his costume, not his training score, not his interview. Even now, as he sits there fiddling with some kind of plastic box, he's easily ignored in the presence of his large and domineering companions. But he must be of some value or they wouldn't have bothered to let him live. Still, seeing him only adds to my sense of unease over why the Careers would possibly leave him as a guard, why they have allowed him to live at all.  All four tributes seem to still be recovering from the tracker jacker attack. Even from here, I can see the large swollen lumps on their bodies. They must not have had the sense to remove the stingers, or if they did, not known about the leaves that healed them. Apparently, whatever medicines they found in the Cornucopia have been ineffective.  The Cornucopia sits in its original position, but its insides have been picked clean. Most of the supplies, held in crates, burlap sacks, and plastic bins, are piled neatly in a pyramid in what seems a questionable distance from the camp. Others are sprinkled around the perimeter of the pyramid, almost mimicking the layout of supplies around the Cornucopia at the onset of the Games. A canopy of netting that, aside from discouraging birds, seems to be useless shelters the pyramid itself.  The whole setup is completely perplexing. The distance, the netting, and the presence of the boy from District 3. One thing's for sure, destroying those supplies is not going to be as simple as it looks. Some other factor is at play here, and I'd better stay put until I figure out what it is. My guess is the pyramid is booby-trapped in some manner. I think of concealed pits, descending nets, a thread that when broken sends a poisonous dart into your heart. Really, the possibilities are endless.  While I am mulling over my options, I hear Cato shout out. He's pointing up to the woods, far beyond me, and without turning I know that Rue must have set the first campfire. We'd made sure to gather enough green wood to make the smoke noticeable. The Careers begin to arm themselves at once.  An argument breaks out. It's loud enough for me to hear that it concerns whether or not the boy from District 3 should stay or accompany them.  ""He's coming. We need him in the woods, and his job's done here anyway. No one can touch those supplies,"" says Cato.  ""What about Lover Boy?"" says the boy from District 1.  ""I keep telling you, forget about him. I know where I cut him. It's a miracle he hasn't bled to death yet. At any rate, he's in no shape to raid us,"" says Cato.  So Peeta is out there in the woods, wounded badly. But I am still in the dark on what motivated him to betray the Careers.  ""Come on,"" says Cato. He thrusts a spear into the hands of the boy from District 3, and they head off in the direction of the fire. The last thing I hear as they enter the woods is Cato saying, ""When we find her, I kill her in my own way, and no one interferes.""  Somehow I don't think he's talking about Rue. She didn't drop a nest of tracker jackers on him.  I stay put for a half an hour or so, trying to figure out what to do about the supplies. The one advantage I have with the bow and arrow is distance. I could send a flaming arrow into the pyramid easily enough  -  I'm a good enough shot to get it through those openings in the net  -  but there's no guarantee it would catch. More likely it'd just burn itself out and then what? I'd have achieved nothing and given them far too much information about myself. That I was here, that I have an accomplice, that I can use the bow and arrow with accuracy.  There's no alternative. I'm going to have to get in closer and see if I can't discover what exactly protects the supplies. In fact, I'm just about to reveal myself when a movement catches my eye. Several hundred yards to my right, I see someone emerge from the woods. For a second, I think it's Rue, but then I recognize Foxface  -  she's the one we couldn't remember this morning  -  creeping out onto the plain. When she decides it's safe, she runs for the pyramid, with quick, small steps. Just before she reaches the circle of supplies that have been littered around the pyramid, she stops, searches the ground, and carefully places her feet on a spot. Then she begins to approach the pyramid with strange little hops, sometimes landing on one foot, teetering slightly, sometimes risking a few steps. At one point, she launches up in the air, over a small barrel and lands poised on her tiptoes. But she overshot slightly, and her momentum throws her forward. I hear her give a sharp squeal as her hands hit the ground, but nothing happens. In a moment, she's regained her feet and continues until she has reached the bulk of the supplies.  So, I'm right about the booby trap, but it's clearly more complex than I had imagined. I was right about the girl, too. How wily is she to have discovered this path into the food and to be able to replicate it so neatly? She fills her pack, taking a few items from a variety of containers, crackers from a crate, a handful of apples from a burlap sack that hangs suspended from a rope off the side of a bin. But only a handful from each, not enough to tip off that the food is missing. Not enough to cause suspicion. And then she's doing her odd little dance back out of the circle and scampering into the woods again, safe and sound.  I realize I'm grinding my teeth in frustration. Foxface has confirmed what I'd already guessed. But what sort of trap have they laid that requires such dexterity? Has so many trigger points? Why did she squeal so as her hands made contact with the earth? You'd have thought. and slowly it begins to dawn on me. you'd have thought the very ground was going to explode.  ""It's mined,"" I whisper. That explains everything. The Careers' willingness to leave their supplies, Foxface's reaction, the involvement of the boy from District 3, where they have the factories, where they make televisions and automobiles and explosives. But where did he get them? In the supplies? That's not the sort of weapon the Gamemakers usually provide, given that they like to see the tributes draw blood personally. I slip out of the bushes and cross to one of the round metal plates that lifted the tributes into the arena. The ground around it has been dug up and patted back down. The land mines were disabled after the sixty seconds we stood on the plates, but the boy from District 3 must have managed to reactivate them. I've never seen anyone in the Games do that. I bet it came as a shock even to the Gamemakers.  Well, hurray for the boy from District 3 for putting one over on them, but what am I supposed to do now? Obviously, I can't go strolling into that mess without blowing myself sky-high. As for sending in a burning arrow, that's more laughable than ever. The mines are set off by pressure. It doesn't have to be a lot, either. One year, a girl dropped her token, a small wooden ball, while she was at her plate, and they literally had to scrape bits of her off the ground.  My arm's pretty good, I might be able to chuck some rocks in there and set off what? Maybe one mine? That could start a chain reaction. Or could it? Would the boy from District 3 have placed the mines in such a way that a single mine would not disturb the others? Thereby protecting the supplies but ensuring the death of the invader. Even if I only blew up one mine, I'd draw the Careers back down on me for sure. And anyway, what am I thinking? There's that net, clearly strung to deflect any such attack. Besides, what I'd really need is to throw about thirty rocks in there at once, setting off a big chain reaction, demolishing the whole lot.  I glance back up at the woods. The smoke from Rue's second fire is wafting toward the sky. By now, the Careers have probably begun to suspect some sort of trick. Time is running out.  There is a solution to this, I know there is, if I can only focus hard enough. I stare at the pyramid, the bins, the crates, too heavy to topple over with an arrow. Maybe one contains cooking oil, and the burning arrow idea is reviving when I realize I could end up losing all twelve of my arrows and not get a direct hit on an oil bin, since I'd just be guessing. I'm genuinely thinking of trying to re-create Foxface's trip up to the pyramid in hopes of finding a new means of destruction when my eyes light on the burlap bag of apples. I could sever the rope in one shot, didn't I do as much in the Training Center? It's a big bag, but it still might only be good for one explosion. If only I could free the apples themselves.  I know what to do. I move into range and give myself three arrows to get the job done. I place my feet carefully, block out the rest of the world as I take meticulous aim, The first arrow tears through the side of the bag near the top, leaving a split in the burlap. The second widens it to a gaping hole. I can see the first apple teetering when I let the third arrow go, catching the torn flap of burlap and ripping it from the bag.  For a moment, everything seems frozen in time. Then the apples spill to the ground and I'm blown backward into the air."
Hunger Games Chapter 17,"The impact with the hard-packed earth of the plain knocks the wind out of me. My backpack does little to soften the blow. Fortunately my quiver has caught in the crook of my elbow, sparing both itself and my shoulder, and my bow is locked in my grasp. The ground still shakes with explosions. I can't hear them. I can't hear anything at the moment. But the apples must have set off enough mines, causing debris to activate the others. I manage to shield my face with my arms as shattered bits of matter, some of it burning, rain down around me. An acrid smoke fills the air, which is not the best remedy for someone trying to regain the ability to breathe.  After about a minute, the ground stops vibrating. I roll on my side and allow myself a moment of satisfaction the sight of the smoldering wreckage that was recently the pyramid. The Careers aren't likely to salvage anything out of that.  I'd better get out of here, I think. They'll be making a beeline for the place. But once I'm on my feet, I realize escape may not be so simple. I'm dizzy. Not the slightly wobbly kind, but the kind that sends the trees swooping around you and causes the earth to move in waves under your feet.  I take a few steps and somehow wind up on my hands and knees. I wait a few minutes to let it pass, but it doesn't.  Panic begins to set in. I can't stay here. Flight is essential. But I can neither walk nor hear. I place a hand to my left ear, the one that was turned toward the blast, and it comes away bloody. Have I gone deaf from the explosion? The idea frightens me. I rely as much on my ears as my eyes as a hunter, maybe more at times. But I can't let my fear show. Absolutely, positively, I am live on every screen in Panem.  No blood trails, I tell myself, and manage to pull my hood up over my head, tie the cord under my chin with uncooperative fingers. That should help soak up the blood. I can't walk, but can I crawl? I move forward tentatively. Yes, if I go very slowly, I can crawl. Most of the woods will offer insufficient cover. My only hope is to make it back to Rue's copse and conceal myself in greenery. I can't get caught out here on my hands and knees in the open. Not only will I face death, it's sure to be a long and painful one at Cato's hand. The thought of Prim having to watch that keeps me doggedly inching my way toward the hideout.  Another blast knocks me flat on my face. A stray mine, set off by some collapsing crate. This happens twice more. I'm reminded of those last few kernels that burst when Prim and I pop corn over the fire at home.  To say I make it in the nick of time is an understatement. I have literally just dragged myself into the tangle of hushes at the base of the trees when there's Cato, barreling onto the plain, soon followed by his companions. His rage is so extreme it might be comical  -  so people really do tear out their hair and beat the ground with their fists  -  if I didn't know that it was aimed at me, at what I have done to him. Add to that my proximity, my inability to run or defend myself, and in fact, the whole thing has me terrified. I'm glad my hiding place makes it impossible for the cameras to get a close shot of me because I'm biting my nails like there's no tomorrow. Gnawing off the last bits of nail polish, trying to keep my teeth from chattering.  The boy from District 3 throws stones into the ruins and must have declared all the mines activated because the Careers are approaching the wreckage.  Cato has finished the first phase of his tantrum and takes out his anger on the smoking remains by kicking open various containers. The other tributes are poking around in the mess, looking for anything to salvage, but there's nothing. The boy from District 3 has done his job too well. This idea must occur to Cato, too, because he turns on the boy and appears to be shouting at him. The boy from District 3 only has time to turn and run before Cato catches him in a headlock from behind. I can see the muscles ripple in Cato's arms as he sharply jerks the boy's head to the side.  It's that quick. The death of the boy from District 3.  The other two Careers seem to be trying to calm Cato down. I can tell he wants to return to the woods, but they keep pointing at the sky, which puzzles me until I realize, Of course. They think whoever set off the explosions is dead.  They don't know about the arrows and the apples. They assume the booby trap was faulty, but that the tribute who blew up the supplies was killed doing it. If there was a cannon shot, it could have been easily lost in the subsequent explosions. The shattered remains of the thief removed by hovercraft. They retire to the far side of the lake to allow the Gamemakers to retrieve the body of the boy from District 3. And they wait.  I suppose a cannon goes off. A hovercraft appears and takes the dead boy. The sun dips below the horizon. Night falls. Up in the sky, I see the seal and know the anthem must have begun. A moment of darkness. They show the boy from District 3. They show the boy from District 10, who must have died this morning. Then the seal reappears. So, now they know. The bomber survived. In the seal's light, I can see Cato and the girl from District 2 put on their night-vision glasses. The boy from District 1 ignites a tree branch for a torch, illuminating the grim determination on all their faces. The Careers stride back into the woods to hunt.  The dizziness has subsided and while my left ear is still deafened, I can hear a ringing in my right, which seems a good sign. There's no point in leaving my hiding place, though. I'm about as safe as I can be, here at the crime scene. They probably think the bomber has a two- or three-hour lead on them. Still it's a long time before I risk moving.  The first thing I do is dig out my own glasses and put them on, which relaxes me a little, to have at least one of my hunter's senses working. I drink some water and wash the blood from my ear. Fearing the smell of meat will draw unwanted predators  -  fresh blood is bad enough  -  I make a good meal out of the greens and roots and berries Rue and I gathered today.  Where is my little ally? Did she make it back to the rendezvous point? Is she worried about me? At least, the sky has shown we're both alive.  I run through the surviving tributes on my fingers. The boy from 1, both from 2, Foxface, both from 11 and 12. Just eight of us. The betting must be getting really hot in the Capitol. They'll be doing special features on each of us now. Probably interviewing our friends and families. It's been a long time since a tribute from District 12 made it into the top eight. And now there are two of us. Although from what Cato said, Peeta's on his way out. Not that Cato is the final word on anything. Didn't he just lose his entire stash of supplies?  Let the Seventy-fourth Hunger Games begin, Cato, I think. Let them begin for real.  A cold breeze has sprung up. I reach for my sleeping bag before I remember I left it with Rue. I was supposed to pick up another one, but what with the mines and all, I forgot. I begin to shiver. Since roosting overnight in a tree isn't sensible anyway, I scoop out a hollow under the bushes and cover myself with leaves and pine needles. I'm still freezing. I lay my sheet of plastic over my upper body and position my backpack to block the wind. It's a little better. I begin to have more sympathy for the girl from District 8 that lit the fire that first night. But now it's me who needs to grit my teeth and tough it out until morning. More leaves, more pine needles. I pull my arms inside my jacket and tuck my knees up to my chest. Somehow, I drift off to sleep.  When I open my eyes, the world looks slightly fractured, and it takes a minute to realize that the sun must be well up and the glasses fragmenting my vision. As I sit up and remove them, I hear a laugh somewhere near the lake and freeze. The laugh's distorted, but the fact that it registered at all means I must be regaining my hearing. Yes, my right ear can hear again, although it's still ringing. As for my left ear, well, at least the bleeding has stopped.  I peer through the bushes, afraid the Careers have returned, trapping me here for an indefinite time. No, it's Foxface, standing in the rubble of the pyramid and laughing. She's smarter than the Careers, actually finding a few useful items in the ashes. A metal pot. A knife blade. I'm perplexed by her amusement until I realize that with the Careers' stores eliminated, she might actually stand a chance. Just like the rest of us. It crosses my mind to reveal myself and enlist her as a second ally against that pack. But I rule it out. There's something about that sly grin that makes me sure that befriending Foxface would ultimately get me a knife in the back. With that in mind, this might be an excellent time to shoot her. But she's heard something, not me, because her head turns away, toward the drop-off, and she sprints for the woods. I wait. No one, nothing shows up. Still, if Foxface thought it was dangerous, maybe it's time for me to get out of here, too. Besides, I'm eager to tell Rue about the pyramid.  Since I've no idea where the Careers are, the route back by the stream seems as good as any. I hurry, loaded bow in one hand, a hunk of cold groosling in the other, because I'm famished now, and not just for leaves and berries but for the fat and protein in the meat. The trip to the stream is uneventful. Once there, I refill my water and wash, taking particular care with my injured ear. Then I travel uphill using the stream as a guide. At one point, I find boot prints in the mud along the bank. The Careers have been here, but not for a while. The prints are deep because they were made in soft mud, but now they're nearly dry in the hot sun. I haven't been careful enough about my own tracks, counting on a light tread and the pine needles to conceal my prints. Now I strip off my boots and socks and go barefoot up the bed of the stream.  The cool water has an invigorating effect on my body, my spirits. I shoot two fish, easy pickings in this slow-moving stream, and go ahead and eat one raw even though I've just had the groosling. The second I'll save for Rue.  Gradually, subtly, the ringing in my right ear diminishes until it's gone entirely. I find myself pawing at my left ear periodically, trying to clean away whatever deadens its ability to collect sounds. If there's improvement, it's undetectable. I can't adjust to deafness in the ear. It makes me feel off-balanced and defenseless to my left. Blind even. My head keeps turning to the injured side, as my right ear tries to compensate for the wall of nothingness where yesterday there was a constant flow of information. The more time that passes, the less hopeful I am that this is an injury that will heal.  When I reach the site of our first meeting, I feel certain it's been undisturbed. There's no sign of Rue, not on the ground or in the trees. This is odd. By now she should have returned, as it's midday. Undoubtedly, she spent the night in a tree somewhere. What else could she do with no light and the Careers with their night-vision glasses tramping around the woods. And the third fire she was supposed to set  -  although I forgot to check for it last night  -  was the farthest from our site of all. She's probably just being cautious about making her way back. I wish she'd hurry, because I don't want to hang around here too long. I want to spend the afternoon traveling to higher ground, hunting as we go. But there's nothing really for me to do but wait.  I wash the blood out of my jacket and hair and clean my ever-growing list of wounds. The burns are much better but I use a bit of medicine on them anyway. The main thing to worry about now is keeping out infection. I go ahead and eat the second fish. It isn't going to last long in this hot sun, but it should be easy enough to spear a few more for Rue. If she would just show up.  Feeling too vulnerable on the ground with my lopsided hearing, I scale a tree to wait. If the Careers show up, this will be a fine place to shoot them from. The sun moves slowly. I do things to pass the time. Chew leaves and apply them to my stings that are deflated but still tender. Comb through my damp hair with my fingers and braid it. Lace my boots back up. Check over my bow and remaining nine arrows. Test my left ear repeatedly for signs of life by rustling a leaf near it, but without good results.  Despite the groosling and the fish, my stomach's growling, and I know I'm going to have what we call a hollow day back in District 12. That's a day where no matter what you put in your belly, it's never enough. Having nothing to do but sit in a tree makes it worse, so I decide to give into it. After all, I've lost a lot of weight in the arena, I need some extra calories. And having the bow and arrows makes me far more confident about my future prospects.  I slowly peel and eat a handful of nuts. My last cracker. The groosling neck. That's good because it takes time to pick clean. Finally, a groosling wing and the bird is history. But it's a hollow day, and even with all that I start daydreaming about food. Particularly the decadent dishes served in the Capitol. The chicken in creamy orange sauce. The cakes and pudding. Bread with butter. Noodles in green sauce. The lamb and dried plum stew. I suck on a few mint leaves and tell myself to get over it. Mint is good because we drink mint tea after supper often, so it tricks my stomach into thinking eating time is over. Sort of.  Dangling up in the tree, with the sun warming me, a mouthful of mint, my bow and arrows at hand. this is the most relaxed I've been since I've entered the arena. If only Rue would show up, and we could clear out. As the shadows grow, so does my restlessness. By late afternoon, I've resolved to go looking for her. I can at least visit the spot where she set the third fire and see if there are any clues to her whereabouts.  Before I go, I scatter a few mint leaves around our old campfire. Since we gathered these some distance away, Rue will understand I've been here, while they'll mean nothing to the Careers.  In less than an hour, I'm at the place where we agreed to have the third fire and I know something has gone amiss. The wood has been neatly arranged, expertly interspersed with tinder, but it has never been lit. Rue set up the fire but never made it back here. Somewhere between the second column of smoke I spied before I blew up the supplies and this point, she ran into trouble.  I have to remind myself she's still alive. Or is she? Could the cannon shot announcing her death have come in the wee hours of the morning when even my good ear was too broken to pick it up? Will she appear in the sky tonight? No, I refuse to believe it. There could be a hundred other explanations. She could have lost her way. Run into a pack of predators or another tribute, like Thresh, and had to hide. Whatever happened, I'm almost certain she's stuck out there, somewhere between the second fire and the unlit one at my feet. Something is keeping her up a tree.  I think I'll go hunt it down.  It's a relief to be doing something after sitting around all afternoon. I creep silently through the shadows, letting them conceal me. But nothing seems suspicious. There's no sign of any kind of struggle, no disruption of the needles on the ground. I've stopped for just a moment when I hear it. I have to cock my head around to the side to be sure, but there it is again. Rue's four-note tune coming out of a mockingjay's mouth. The one that means she's all right.  I grin and move in the direction of the bird. Another just a short distance ahead, picks up on the handful of notes. Rue has been singing to them, and recently. Otherwise they'd have taken up some other song. My eyes lift up into the trees, searching for a sign of her. I swallow and sing softly back, hoping she'll know it's safe to join me. A mockingjay repeats the melody to me. And that's when I hear the scream.  It's a child's scream, a young girl's scream, there's no one in the arena capable of making that sound except Rue. And now I'm running, knowing this may be a trap, knowing the three Careers may be poised to attack me, but I can't help myself. There's another high-pitched cry, this time my name. ""Katniss! Katniss!""  ""Rue!"" I shout back, so she knows I'm near. So, they know I'm near, and hopefully the girl who has attacked them with tracker jackers and gotten an eleven they still can't explain will be enough to pull their attention away from her. ""Rue! I'm coming!""  When I break into the clearing, she's on the ground, hopelessly entangled in a net. She just has time to reach her hand through the mesh and say my name before the spear enters her body."
Hunger Games Chapter 18,"The boy from District 1 dies before he can pull out the spear. My arrow drives deeply into the center of his neck. He falls to his knees and halves the brief remainder of his life by yanking out the arrow and drowning in his own blood. I'm reloaded, shifting my aim from side to side, while I shout at Rue, ""Are there more? Are there more?""  She has to say no several times before I hear it. Rue has rolled to her side, her body curved in and around the spear. I shove the boy away from her and pull out my knife, freeing her from the net. One look at the wound and I know it's far beyond my capacity to heal, beyond anyone's probably. The spearhead is buried up to the shaft in her stomach. I crouch before her, staring helplessly at the embedded weapon. There's no point in comforting words, in telling her she'll be all right. She's no fool. Her hand reaches out and I clutch it like a lifeline. As if it's me who's dying instead of Rue.  ""You blew up the food?"" she whispers.  ""Every last bit,"" I say.  ""You have to win,"" she says.  ""I'm going to. Going to win for both of us now,"" I promise. I hear a cannon and look up. It must be for the boy from District 1.  ""Don't go."" Rue tightens her grip on my hand.  ""Course not. Staying right here,"" I say. I move in closer to her, pulling her head onto my lap. I gently brush the dark, thick hair back behind her ear.  ""Sing,"" she says, but I barely catch the word.  Sing? I think. Sing what? I do know a few songs. Believe it or not, there was once music in my house, too. Music I helped make. My father pulled me in with that remarkable voice  -  but I haven't sung much since he died. Except when Prim is very sick. Then I sing her the same songs she liked as a baby.  Sing. My throat is tight with tears, hoarse from smoke and fatigue. But if this is Prim's, I mean, Rue's last request, I have to at least try. The song that comes to me is a simple lullaby, one we sing fretful, hungry babies to sleep with, It's old, very old I think. Made up long ago in our hills. What my music teacher calls a mountain air. But the words are easy and soothing, promising tomorrow will be more hopeful than this awful piece of time we call today.  I give a small cough, swallow hard, and begin:  Deep in the meadow, under the willow  A bed of grass, a soft green pillow  Lay down your head, and close your sleepy eyes  And when again they open, the sun will rise.  Here it's safe, here it's warm  Here the daisies guard you from every harm  Here your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings them true  Here is the place where I love you.  Rue's eyes have fluttered shut. Her chest moves but only slightly. My throat releases the tears and they slide down my cheeks. But I have to finish the song for her.  Deep in the meadow, hidden far away  A cloak of leaves, a moonbeam ray  Forget your woes and let your troubles lay  And when again it's morning, they'll wash away.  Here it's safe, here it's warm  Here the daisies guard you from every harm  The final lines are barely audible.  Here your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings them true  Here is the place where I love you.  Everything's still and quiet. Then, almost eerily, the mockingjays take up my song.  For a moment, I sit there, watching my tears drip down on her face. Rue's cannon fires. I lean forward and press my lips against her temple. Slowly, as if not to wake her, I lay her head back on the ground and release her hand.  They'll want me to clear out now. So they can collect the bodies. And there's nothing to stay for. I roll the boy from District 1 onto his face and take his pack, retrieve the arrow that ended his life. I cut Rue's pack from her back as well, knowing she'd want me to have it but leave the spear in her stomach. Weapons in bodies will be transported to the hovercraft. I've no use for a spear, so the sooner it's gone from the arena the better.  I can't stop looking at Rue, smaller than ever, a baby animal curled up in a nest of netting. I can't bring myself to leave her like this. Past harm, but seeming utterly defenseless. To hate the boy from District 1, who also appears so vulnerable in death, seems inadequate. It's the Capitol I hate, for doing this to all of us.  Gale's voice is in my head. His ravings against the Capitol no longer pointless, no longer to be ignored. Rue's death has forced me to confront my own fury against the cruelty, the injustice they inflict upon us. But here, even more strongly than at home, I feel my impotence. There's no way to take revenge on the Capitol. Is there?  Then I remember Peeta's words on the roof. ""Only I keep wishing I could think of a way to. to show the Capital they don't own me. That I'm more than just a piece in their Games."" And for the first time, I understand what he means.  I want to do something, right here, right now, to shame them, to make them accountable, to show the Capitol that whatever they do or force us to do there is a part of every tribute they can't own. That Rue was more than a piece in their Games. And so am I.  A few steps into the woods grows a bank of wildflowers. Perhaps they are really weeds of some sort, but they have blossoms in beautiful shades of violet and yellow and white. I gather up an armful and come back to Rue's side. Slowly, one stem at a time, I decorate her body in the flowers. Covering the ugly wound. Wreathing her face. Weaving her hair with bright colors.  They'll have to show it. Or, even if they choose to turn the cameras elsewhere at this moment, they'll have to bring them back when they collect the bodies and everyone will see her then and know I did it. I step back and take a last look at Rue. She could really be asleep in that meadow after all.  ""Bye, Rue,"" I whisper. I press the three middle fingers of my left hand against my lips and hold them out in her direction. Then I walk away without looking back.  The birds fall silent. Somewhere, a mockingjay gives the warning whistle that precedes the hovercraft. I don't know how it knows. It must hear things that humans can't. I pause, my eyes focused on what's ahead, not what's happening behind me. It doesn't take long, then the general birdsong begins again and I know she's gone.  Another mockingjay, a young one by the look of it, lands on a branch before me and bursts out Rue's melody.  My song, the hovercraft, were too unfamiliar for this novice to pick up, but it has mastered her handful of notes. The ones that mean she's safe.  ""Good and safe,"" I say as I pass under its branch. ""We don't have to worry about her now."" Good and safe.  I've no idea where to go. The brief sense of home I had that one night with Rue has vanished. My feet wander this way and that until sunset. I'm not afraid, not even watchful. Which makes me an easy target. Except I'd kill anyone I met on sight. Without emotion or the slightest tremor in my hands. My hatred of the Capitol has not lessened my hatred of my competitors in the least. Especially the Careers. They, at least, can be made to pay for Rue's death.  No one materializes though. There aren't many of us left and it's a big arena. Soon they'll be pulling out some other device to force us together. But there's been enough gore today. Perhaps we'll even get to sleep.  I'm about to haul my packs into a tree to make camp when a silver parachute floats down and lands in front of me. A gift from a sponsor. But why now? I've been in fairly good shape with supplies. Maybe Haymitch's noticed my despondency and is trying to cheer me up a bit. Or could it be something to help my ear?  I open the parachute and find a small loaf of bread It's not the fine white Capitol stuff. It's made of dark ration grain and shaped in a crescent. Sprinkled with seeds. I flash back to Peeta's lesson on the various district breads in the Training Center. This bread came from District 11. I cautiously lift the still warm loaf. What must it have cost the people of District 11 who can't even feed themselves? How many would've had to do without to scrape up a coin to put in the collection for this one loaf? It had been meant for Rue, surely. But instead of pulling the gift when she died, they'd authorized Haymitch to give it to me. As a thank-you? Or because, like me, they don't like to let debts go unpaid? For whatever reason, this is a first. A district gift to a tribute who's not your own.  I lift my face and step into the last falling rays of sunlight. ""My thanks to the people of District Eleven,"" I say. I want them to know I know where it came from. That the full value of their gift has been recognized.  I climb dangerously high into a tree, not for safety but to get as far away from today as I can. My sleeping bag is rolled neatly in Rue's pack. Tomorrow I'll sort through the supplies. Tomorrow I'll make a new plan. But tonight, all I can do is strap myself in and take tiny bites of the bread. It's good. It tastes of home.  Soon the seal's in the sky, the anthem plays in my right ear. I see the boy from District 1, Rue. That's all for tonight. Six of us left, I think. Only six. With the bread still locked in my hands, I fall asleep at once.  Sometimes when things are particularly bad, my brain will give me a happy dream. A visit with my father in the woods. An hour of sunlight and cake with Prim. Tonight it sends me Rue, still decked in her flowers, perched in a high sea of trees, trying to teach me to talk to the mockingjays. I see no sign of her wounds, no blood, just a bright, laughing girl. She sings songs I've never heard in a clear, melodic voice. On and on. Through the night. There's a drowsy in-between period when I can hear the last few strains of her music although she's lost in the leaves. When I fully awaken, I'm momentarily comforted. I try to hold on to the peaceful feeling of the dream, but it quickly slips away, leaving me sadder and lonelier than ever.  Heaviness infuses my whole body, as if there's liquid lead in my veins. I've lost the will to do the simplest tasks, to do anything but lie here, staring unblinkingly through the canopy of leaves. For several hours, I remain motionless. As usual, it's the thought of Prim's anxious face as she watches me on the screens back home that breaks me from my lethargy.  I give myself a series of simple commands to follow, like ""Now you have to sit up, Katniss. Now you have to drink water, Katniss."" I act on the orders with slow, robotic motions. ""Now you have to sort the packs, Katniss.""  Rue's pack holds my sleeping bag, her nearly empty water skin, a handful of nuts and roots, a bit of rabbit, her extra socks, and her slingshot. The boy from District 1 has several knives, two spare spearheads, a flashlight, a small leather pouch, a first-aid kit, a full bottle of water, and a pack of dried fruit. A pack of dried fruit! Out of all he might have chosen from. To me, this is a sign of extreme arrogance. Why bother to carry food when you have such a bounty back at camp? When you will kill your enemies so quickly you'll be home before you're hungry? I can only hope the other Careers traveled so lightly when it came to food and now find themselves with nothing.  Speaking of which, my own supply is running low. I finish off the loaf from District 11 and the last of the rabbit. How quickly the food disappears. All I have left are Rue's roots and nuts, the boy's dried fruit, and one strip of beef. Now you have to hunt, Katniss, I tell myself.  I obediently consolidate the supplies I want into my pack. After I climb down the tree, I conceal the boy's knives and spearheads in a pile of rocks so that no one else can use them. I've lost my bearings what with all the wandering around I did yesterday evening, but I try and head back in the general direction of the stream. I know I'm on course when I come across Rue's third, unlit fire. Shortly thereafter, I discover a flock of grooslings perched in the trees and take out three before they know what hit them. I return to Rue's signal fire and start it up, not caring about the excessive smoke. Where are you, Cato? I think as I roast the birds and Rue's roots. I'm waiting right here.  Who knows where the Careers are now? Either too far to reach me or too sure this is a trick or... is it possible? Too scared of me? They know I have the bow and arrows, of course, Cato saw me take them from Glimmer's body, but have they put two and two together yet? Figured out I blew up the supplies and killed their fellow Career? Possibly they think Thresh did this. Wouldn't he be more likely to revenge Rue's death than I would? Being from the same district? Not that he ever took any interest in her.  And what about Foxface? Did she hang around to watch me blow up the supplies? No. When I caught her laughing in the ashes the next morning, it was as if someone had given her a lovely surprise.  I doubt they think Peeta has lit this signal fire. Cato's sure he's as good as dead. I find myself wishing I could tell Peeta about the flowers I put on Rue. That I now understand what he was trying to say on the roof. Perhaps if he wins the Games, he'll see me on victor's night, when they replay the highlights of the Games on a screen over the stage where we did our interviews. The winner sits in a place of honor on the platform, surrounded by their support crew.  But I told Rue I'd be there. For both of us. And somehow that seems even more important than the vow I gave Prim.  I really think I stand a chance of doing it now. Winning. It's not just having the arrows or outsmarting the Careers a few times, although those things help. Something happened when I was holding Rue's hand, watching the life drain out of her. Now I am determined to revenge her, to make her loss unforgettable, and I can only do that by winning and thereby making myself unforgettable.  I overcook the birds hoping someone will show up to shoot, but no one does. Maybe the other tributes are out there beating one another senseless. Which would be fine, Ever since the bloodbath, I've been featured on screens most than I care.  Eventually, I wrap up my food and go back to the stream to replenish my water and gather some. But the heaviness from the morning drapes back over me and even though it's only early evening, I climb a tree and settle in for the night. My brain begins to replay the events from yesterday. I keep seeing Rue speared, my arrow piercing the boy's neck. I don't know why I should even care about the boy.  Then I realize. he was my first kill.  Along with other statistics they report to help people place their bets, every tribute has a list of kills. I guess technically I'd get credited for Glimmer and the girl from District 4, too, for dumping that nest on them. But the boy from District 1 was the first person I knew would die because of my actions. Numerous animals have lost their lives at my hands, but only one human. I hear Gale saying, ""How different can it be, really?""  Amazingly similar in the execution. A bow pulled, an arrow shot. Entirely different in the aftermath. I killed a boy whose name I don't even know. Somewhere his family is weeping for him. His friends call for my blood. Maybe he had a girlfriend who really believed he would come back.  But then I think of Rue's still body and I'm able to banish the boy from my mind. At least, for now.  It's been an uneventful day according to the sky. No deaths. I wonder how long we'll get until the next catastrophe drives us back together. If it's going to be tonight, I want to get some sleep first. I cover my good ear to block out the strains of the anthem, but then I hear the trumpets and sit straight up in anticipation.  For the most part, the only communication the tributes get from outside the arena is the nightly death toll. But occasionally, there will be trumpets followed by an announcement. Usually, this will be a call to a feast. When food is scarce, the Gamemakers will invite the players to a banquet, somewhere known to all like the Cornucopia, as an inducement to gather and fight. Sometimes there is a feast and sometimes there's nothing but a loaf of stale bread for the tributes to compete for. I wouldn't go in for the food, but this could be an ideal time to take out a few competitors.  Claudius Templesmith's voice booms down from overhead, congratulating the six of us who remain. But he is not inviting us to a feast. He's saying something very confusing. There's been a rule change in the Games. A rule change! That in itself is mind bending since we don't really have any rules to speak of except don't step off your circle for sixty seconds and the unspoken rule about not eating one another. Under the new rule, both tributes from the same district will be declared winners if they are the last two alive. Claudius pauses, as if he knows we're not getting it, and repeats the change again.  The news sinks in. Two tributes can win this year. If they're from the same district. Both can live. Both of us can live.  Before I can stop myself, I call out Peeta's name."
Hunger Games Chapter 19,"I clap my hands over my mouth, but the sound has already escaped. The sky goes black and I hear a chorus of frogs begin to sing. Stupid! I tell myself. What a stupid thing to do! I wait, frozen, for the woods to come alive with assailants. Then I remember there's almost no one left.  Peeta, who's been wounded, is now my ally. Whatever doubts I've had about him dissipate because if either of us took the other's life now we'd be pariahs when we returned to District 12. In fact, I know if I was watching I'd loathe any tribute who didn't immediately ally with their district partner. Besides, it just makes sense to protect each other. And in my case  -  being one of the star-crossed lovers from District 12  -  it's an absolute requirement if I want any more help from sympathetic sponsors.  The star-crossed lovers. Peeta must have been playing that angle all along. Why else would the Gamemakers have made this unprecedented change in the rules? For two tributes to have a shot at winning, our ""romance"" must be so popular with the audience that condemning it would jeopardize the success of the Games. No thanks to me. All I've done is managed not to kill Peeta. But whatever he's done in the arena, he must have the audience convinced it was to keep me alive. Shaking his head to keep me from running to the Cornucopia. Fighting Cato to let me escape. Even hooking up with the Careers must have been a move to protect me. Peeta, it turns out, has never been a danger to me.  The thought makes me smile. I drop my hands and hold my face up to the moonlight so the cameras can be sure to catch it.  So, who is there left to be afraid of? Foxface? The boy tribute from her district is dead. She's operating alone, at night. And her strategy has been to evade, not attack. I don't really think that, even if she heard my voice, she'd do anything but hope someone else would kill me.  Then there's Thresh. All right, he's a distinct threat. But I haven't seen him, not once, since the Games began. I think about how Foxface grew alarmed when she heard a sound at the site of the explosion. But she didn't turn to the Woods, she turned to whatever lies across from it. To that area of the arena that drops off into I don't know what. I feel almost certain that the person she ran from was Thresh and that is his domain. He'd never have heard me from there and, even if he did, I'm up too high for someone his size to reach.  So that leaves Cato and the girl from District 2, who are now surely celebrating the new rule. They're the only ones left who benefit from it besides Peeta and myself. Do I run from them now, on the chance they heard me call Peeta's name? No, I think. Let them come. Let them come with their night-vision glasses and their heavy, branch-breaking bodies.  Right into the range of my arrows. But I know they won't. If they didn't come in daylight to my fire, they won't risk what could be another trap at night. When they come, it will be on their own terms, not because I've let them know my whereabouts.  Stay put and get some sleep, Katniss, I instruct myself, although I wish I could start tracking Peeta now. Tomorrow, you'll find him.  I do sleep, but in the morning I'm extra-cautious, thinking that while the Careers might hesitate to attack me in a tree, they're completely capable of setting an ambush for me. I make sure to fully prepare myself for the day  -  eating a big breakfast, securing my pack, readying my weapons  -  before I descend. But all seems peaceful and undisturbed on the ground.  Today I'll have to be scrupulously careful. The Careers will know I'm trying to locate Peeta. They may well want to wait until I do before they move in. If he's as badly wounded as Cato thinks, I'd be in the position of having to defend us both without any assistance. But if he's that incapacitated, how has he managed to stay alive? And how on earth will I find him?  I try to think of anything Peeta ever said that might give me an indication as to where he's hiding out, but nothing rings a bell. So I go back to the last moment I saw him sparkling in the sunlight, yelling at me to run. Then Cato appeared, his sword drawn. And after I was gone, he wounded Peeta. But how did Peeta get away? Maybe he'd held out better against the tracker jacker poison than Cato.  Maybe that was the variable that allowed him to escape. But he'd been stung, too. So how far could he have gotten, stabbed and filled with venom? And how has he stayed alive all these days since? If the wound and the stingers haven't killed him, surely thirst would have taken him by now.  And that's when I get my first clue to his whereabouts. He couldn't have survived without water. I know that from my first few days here. He must be hidden somewhere near a source. There's the lake, but I find that an unlikely option since it's so close to the Careers' base camp. A few spring-fed pools. But you'd really be a sitting duck at one of those. And the stream. The one that leads from the camp Rue and I made all the way down near the lake and beyond. If he stuck to the stream, he could change his location and always be near water. He could walk in the current and erase any tracks. He might even be able to get a fish or two.  Well, it's a place to start, anyway.  To confuse my enemies' minds, I start a fire with plenty of green wood. Even if they think it's a ruse, I hope they'll decide I'm hidden somewhere near it. While in reality, I'll be tracking Peeta.  The sun burns off the morning haze almost immediately and I can tell the day will be hotter than usual. The waters cool and pleasant on my bare feet as I head downstream. I'm tempted to call out Peeta's name as I go but decide against it. I will have to find him with my eyes and one good ear or he will have to find me. But he'll know I'll be looking, right? He won't have so low of an opinion of me as to think I'd ignore the new rule and keep to myself. Would he? He's very hard to predict, which might be interesting under different circumstances, but at the moment only provides an extra obstacle.  It doesn't take long to reach the spot where I peeled off to go the Careers' camp. There's been no sign of Peeta, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been up and down this stretch three times since the tracker jacker incident. If he were nearby, surely I'd have had some suspicion of it. The stream begins to curve to the left into a part of the woods that's new to me. Muddy banks covered in tangled water plants lead to large rocks that increase in size until I begin to feel somewhat trapped. It would be no small matter to escape the stream now. Fighting off Cato or Thresh as I climbed over this rocky terrain. In fact, I've just about decided I'm on the wrong track entirely, that a wounded boy would be unable to navigate getting to and from this water source, when I see the bloody streak going down the curve of a boulder. It's long dried now, but the smeary lines running side to side suggest someone  -  who perhaps was not fully in control of his mental faculties  -  tried to wipe it away.  Hugging the rocks, I move slowly in the direction of the blood, searching for him. I find a few more bloodstains, one with a few threads of fabric glued to it, but no sign of life. I break down and say his name in a hushed voice. ""Peeta! Peeta!"" Then a mockingjay lands on a scruffy tree and begins to mimic my tones so I stop. I give up and climb back down to the stream thinking, He must have moved on. Somewhere farther down.  My foot has just broken the surface of the water when I hear a voice.  ""You here to finish me off, sweetheart?""  I whip around. It's come from the left, so I can't pick it up very well. And the voice was hoarse and weak. Still, it must have been Peeta. Who else in the arena would call me sweetheart? My eyes peruse the bank, but there's nothing. Just mud, the plants, the base of the rocks.  ""Peeta?"" I whisper. ""Where are you?"" There's no answer. Could I just have imagined it? No, I'm certain it was real and very close at hand, too. ""Peeta?"" I creep along the bank.  ""Well, don't step on me.""  I jump back. His voice was right under my feet. Still there's nothing. Then his eyes open, unmistakably blue in the brown mud and green leaves. I gasp and am rewarded with a hint of white teeth as he laughs.  It's the final word in camouflage. Forget chucking weights around. Peeta should have gone into his private session with the Gamemakers and painted himself into a tree. Or a boulder. Or a muddy bank full of weeds.  ""Close your eyes again,"" I order. He does, and his mouth, too, and completely disappears. Most of what I judge to be his body is actually under a layer of mud and plants. His face and arms are so artfully disguised as to be invisible. I kneel beside him. ""I guess all those hours decorating cakes paid off.""  Peeta smiles. ""Yes, frosting. The final defense of the dying.""  ""You're not going to die,"" I tell him firmly. ""Says who?"" His voice is so ragged. ""Says me. We're on the same team now, you know,"" I tell him.  His eyes open. ""So, I heard. Nice of you to find what's left of me.""  I pull out my water bottle and give him a drink. ""Did Cato cut you?"" I ask.  ""Left leg. Up high,"" he answers.  ""Let's get you in the stream, wash you off so I can see what kind of wounds you've got,"" I say.  ""Lean down a minute first,"" he says. ""Need to tell you something."" I lean over and put my good ear to his lips, which tickle as he whispers. ""Remember, we're madly in love, so it's all right to kiss me anytime you feel like it.""  I jerk my head back but end up laughing. ""Thanks, I'll keep it in mind."" At least, he's still able to joke around. But when I start to help him to the stream, all the levity disappears. It's only two feet away, how hard can it be? Very hard when I realize he's unable to move an inch on his own. He's so weak that the best he can do is not to resist. I try to drag him, but despite the fact that I know he's doing all he can to keep quiet, sharp cries of pain escape him. The mud and plants seem to have imprisoned him and I finally have to give a gigantic tug to break him from their clutches. He's still two feet from the water, lying there, teeth gritted, tears cutting trails in the dirt on his face.  ""Look, Peeta, I'm going to roll you into the stream. It's very shallow here, okay?"" I say.  ""Excellent,"" he says.  I crouch down beside him. No matter what happens, I tell myself, don't stop until he's in the water. ""On three,"" I say. ""One, two, three!"" I can only manage one full roll before I have to stop because of the horrible sound he's making. Now he's on the edge of the stream. Maybe this is better anyway.  ""Okay, change of plans. I'm not going to put you all the way in,"" I tell him. Besides, if I get him in, who knows if I'd ever be able to get him out?  ""No more rolling?"" he asks.  ""That's all done. Let's get you cleaned up. Keep an eye on the woods for me, okay?"" I say. It's hard to know where to start. He so caked with mud and matted leaves, I can't even see his clothes. If he's wearing clothes. The thought makes me hesitate a moment, but then I plunge in. Naked bodies are no big deal in the arena, right?  I've got two water bottles and Rue's water skin. I prop them against rocks in the stream so that two are always filling while I pour the third over Peeta's body. It takes a while, but I finally get rid of enough mud to find his clothes. I gently unzip his jacket, unbutton his shirt and ease them off him. His undershirt is so plastered into his wounds I have to cut it away with my knife and drench him again to work it loose. He's badly bruised with a long burn across his chest and four tracker jacker stings, if you count the one under his ear. But I feel a bit better. This much I can fix. I decide to take care of his upper body first, to alleviate some pain, before I tackle whatever damage Cato did to his leg.  Since treating his wounds seems pointless when he's lying in what's become a mud puddle, I manage to prop him up against a boulder. He sits there, uncomplaining, while I wash away all the traces of dirt from his hair and skin. His flesh is very pale in the sunlight and he no longer looks strong and stocky. I have to dig the stingers out of his tracker jacker lumps, which causes him to wince, but the minute I apply the leaves he sighs in relief. While he dries in the sun, I wash his filthy shirt and jacket and spread them over boulders. Then I apply the burn cream to his chest. This is when I notice how hot his skin is becoming. The layer of mud and the bottles of water have disguised the fact that he's burning with fever. I dig through the first-aid kit I got from the boy from District 1 and find pills that reduce your temperature. My mother actually breaks down and buys these on occasion when her home remedies fail.  ""Swallow these,"" I tell him, and he obediently takes the medicine. ""You must be hungry.""  ""Not really. It's funny, I haven't been hungry for days,"" says Peeta. In fact, when I offer him groosling, he wrinkles his nose at it and turns away. That's when I know how sick he is.  ""Peeta, we need to get some food in you,"" I insist.  ""It'll just come right back up,"" he says. The best I can do is to get him to eat a few bits of dried apple. ""Thanks. I'm much better, really. Can I sleep now, Katniss?"" he asks.  ""Soon,"" I promise. ""I need to look at your leg first."" Trying to be as gentle as I can, I remove his boots, his socks, and then very slowly inch his pants off of him. I can see the tear Cato's sword made in the fabric over his thigh, but it in no way prepares me for what lies underneath. The deep inflamed gash oozing both blood and pus. The swelling of the leg. And worst of all, the smell of festering flesh.  I want to run away. Disappear into the woods like I did that day they brought the burn victim to our house. Go and hunt while my mother and Prim attend to what I have neither the skill nor the courage to face. But there's no one here but me. I try to capture the calm demeanor my mother assumes when handling particularly bad cases.  ""Pretty awful, huh?"" says Peeta. He's watching me closely.  ""So-so."" I shrug like it's no big deal. ""You should see some of the people they bring my mother from the mines."" I refrain from saying how I usually clear out of the house whenever she's treating anything worse than a cold. Come to think of it, I don't even much like to be around coughing. ""First thing is to clean it well.""  I've left on Peeta's undershorts because they're not in bad shape and I don't want to pull them over the swollen thigh and, all right, maybe the idea of him being naked makes me uncomfortable. That's another thing about my mother and Prim. Nakedness has no effect on them, gives them no cause for embarrassment. Ironically, at this point in the Games, my little sister would be of far more use to Peeta than I am. I scoot my square of plastic under him so I can wash down the rest of him. With each bottle I pour over him, the worse the wound looks. The rest of his lower body has fared pretty well, just one tracker jacker sting and a few small burns that I treat quickly. But the gash on his leg. what on earth can I do for that?  ""Why don't we give it some air and then. "" I trail off.  ""And then you'll patch it up?"" says Peeta. He looks almost sorry for me, as if he knows how lost I am.  ""That's right,"" I say. ""In the meantime, you eat these."" I put a few dried pear halves in his hand and go back in the stream to wash the rest of his clothes. When they're flattened out and drying, I examine the contents of the first-aid kit. It's pretty basic stuff. Bandages, fever pills, medicine to calm stomachs. Nothing of the caliber I'll need to treat Peeta.  ""We're going to have to experiment some,"" I admit. I know the tracker jacker leaves draw out infection, so I start with those. Within minutes of pressing the handful of chewed-up green stuff into the wound, pus begins running down the side of his leg. I tell myself this is a good thing and bite the inside of my cheek hard because my breakfast is threatening to make a reappearance.  ""Katniss?"" Peeta says. I meet his eyes, knowing my face must be some shade of green. He mouths the words. ""How about that kiss?""  I burst out laughing because the whole thing is so revolting I can't stand it.  ""Something wrong?"" he asks a little too innocently.  ""I. I'm no good at this. I'm not my mother. I've no idea what I'm doing and I hate pus,"" I say. ""Euh!"" I allow myself to let out a groan as I rinse away the first round of leaves and apply the second. ""Euuuh!""  ""How do you hunt?"" he asks.  ""Trust me. Killing things is much easier than this,"" I say. ""Although for all I know, I am killing you.""  ""Can you speed it up a little?"" he asks.  ""No. Shut up and eat your pears,"" I say.  After three applications and what seems like a bucket of pus, the wound does look better. Now that the swelling has gone down, I can see how deep Cato's sword cut. Right down to the bone.  ""What next, Dr. Everdeen?"" he asks.  ""Maybe I'll put some of the burn ointment on it. I think it helps with infection anyway. And wrap it up?"" I say. I do and the whole thing seems a lot more manageable, covered in clean white cotton. Although, against the sterile bandage, the hem of his undershorts looks filthy and teeming with contagion. I pull out Rue's backpack. ""Here, cover yourself with this and I'll wash your shorts.""  ""Oh, I don't care if you see me,"" says Peeta.  ""You're just like the rest of my family,"" I say. ""I care, all right?"" I turn my back and look at the stream until the undershorts splash into the current. He must be feeling a bit better if he can throw.  ""You know, you're kind of squeamish for such a lethal person,"" says Peeta as I beat the shorts clean between two rocks. ""I wish I'd let you give Haymitch a shower after all.""  I wrinkle my nose at the memory. ""What's he sent you so far?""  ""Not a thing,"" says Peeta. Then there's a pause as it hits him. ""Why, did you get something?""  ""Burn medicine,"" I say almost sheepishly. ""Oh, and some bread.""  ""I always knew you were his favorite,"" says Peeta.  ""Please, he can't stand being in the same room with me,"" I say.  ""Because you're just alike,"" mutters Peeta. I ignore it though because this really isn't the time for me to be insulting Haymitch, which is my first impulse.  I let Peeta doze off while his clothes dry out, but by late afternoon, I don't dare wait any longer. I gently shake his shoulder. ""Peeta, we've got to go now.""  ""Go?"" He seems confused. ""Go where?""  ""Away from here. Downstream maybe. Somewhere we can hide you until you're stronger,"" I say. I help him dress, leaving his feet bare so we can walk in the water, and pull him upright. His face drains of color the moment he puts weight on his leg. ""Come on. You can do this.""  But he can't. Not for long anyway. We make it about fifty yards downstream, with him propped up by my shoulder, and I can tell he's going to black out. I sit him on the bank, push his head between his knees, and pat his back awkwardly as I survey the area. Of course, I'd love to get him up in a tree, but that's not going to happen. It could be worse though. Some of the rocks form small cavelike structures. I set my sights on one about twenty yards above the stream. When Peeta's able to stand, I half-guide, half-carry him up to the cave. Really, I'd like to look around for a better place, but this one will have to do because my ally is shot. Paper white, panting, and, even though it's only just cooling off, he's shivering.  I cover the floor of the cave with a layer of pine needles, unroll my sleeping bag, and tuck him into it. I get a couple of pills and some water into him when he's not noticing, but he refuses to eat even the fruit. Then he just lies there, his eyes trained on my face as I build a sort of blind out of vines to conceal the mouth of the cave. The result is unsatisfactory. An animal might not question it, but a human would see hands had manufactured it quickly enough. I tear it down in frustration.  ""Katniss,"" he says. I go over to him and brush the hair back from his eyes. ""Thanks for finding me.""  ""You would have found me if you could,"" I say. His forehead's burning up. Like the medicine's having no effect at all. Suddenly, out of nowhere, I'm scared he's going to die.  ""Yes. Look, if I don't make it back  - "" he begins.  ""Don't talk like that. I didn't drain all that pus for nothing,"" I say.  ""I know. But just in case I don't  - "" he tries to continue.  ""No, Peeta, I don't even want to discuss it,"" I say, placing my fingers on his lips to quiet him.  ""But I  - "" he insists.  Impulsively, I lean forward and kiss him, stopping his words. This is probably overdue anyway since he's right, we are supposed to be madly in love. It's the first time I've ever kissed a boy, which should make some sort of impression I guess, but all I can register is how unnaturally hot his lips are from the fever. I break away and pull the edge of the sleeping bag up around him. ""You're not going to die. I forbid it. All right?""  ""All right,"" he whispers.  I step out in the cool evening air just as the parachute floats down from the sky. My fingers quickly undo the tie, hoping for some real medicine to treat Peeta's leg. Instead I find a pot of hot broth.  Haymitch couldn't be sending me a clearer message. One kiss equals one pot of broth. I can almost hear his snarl. ""You're supposed to be in love, sweetheart. The boy's dying. Give me something I can work with!""  And he's right. If I want to keep Peeta alive, I've got to give the audience something more to care about. Star-crossed lovers desperate to get home together. Two hearts beating as one. Romance.  Never having been in love, this is going to be a real trick. I think of my parents. The way my father never failed to bring her gifts from the woods. The way my mother's face would light up at the sound of his boots at the door. The way she almost stopped living when he died.  ""Peeta!"" I say, trying for the special tone that my mother used only with my father. He's dozed off again, but I kiss him awake, which seems to startle him. Then he smiles as if he'd be happy to lie there gazing at me forever. He's great at this stuff.  I hold up the pot. ""Peeta, look what Haymitch has sent you."""
Hunger Games Chapter 20,"Getting the broth into Peeta takes an hour of coaxing, begging, threatening, and yes, kissing, but finally, sip by sip, he empties the pot. I let him drift off to sleep then and attend to my own needs, wolfing down a supper of groosling and roots while I watch the daily report in the sky. No new casualties. Still, Peeta and I have given the audience a fairly interesting day. Hopefully, the Gamemakers will allow us a peaceful night.  I automatically look around for a good tree to nest in before I realize that's over. At least for a while. I can't very well leave Peeta unguarded on the ground. I left the scene of his last hiding place on the bank of the stream untouched  -  how could I conceal it?  -  and we're a scant fifty yards downstream. I put on my glasses, place my weapons in readiness, and settle down to keep watch.  The temperature drops rapidly and soon I'm chilled to the bone. Eventually, I give in and slide into the sleeping bag with Peeta. It's toasty warm and I snuggle down gratefully until I realize it's more than warm, it's overly hot because the bag is reflecting back his fever. I check his forehead and find it burning and dry. I don't know what to do. Leave him in the bag and hope the excessive heat breaks the fever? Take him out and hope the night air cools him off? I end up just dampening a strip of bandage and placing it on his forehead. It seems weak, but I'm afraid to do anything too drastic.  I spend the night half-sitting, half-lying next to Peeta, refreshing the bandage, and trying not to dwell on the fact that by teaming up with him, I've made myself far more vulnerable than when I was alone. Tethered to the ground, on guard, with a very sick person to take care of. But I knew he was injured. And still I came after him. I'm just going to have to trust that whatever instinct sent me to find him was a good one.  When the sky turns rosy, I notice the sheen of sweat on Peeta's lip and discover the fever has broken. He's not back to normal, but it's come down a few degrees. Last night, when I was gathering vines, I came upon a bush of Rue's berries. I strip off the fruit and mash it up in the broth pot with cold water.  Peeta's struggling to get up when I reach the cave. ""I woke up and you were gone,"" he says. ""I was worried about you.""  I have to laugh as I ease him back down. ""You were worried about me? Have you taken a look at yourself lately?""  ""I thought Cato and Clove might have found you. They like to hunt at night,"" he says, still serious.  ""Clove? Which one is that?"" I ask.  ""The girl from District Two. She's still alive, right?"" he says.  ""Yes, there's just them and us and Thresh and Foxface,"" I say. ""That's what I nicknamed the girl from Five. How do you feel?""  ""Better than yesterday. This is an enormous improvement over the mud,"" he says. ""Clean clothes and medicine and a sleeping bag. and you.""  Oh, right, the whole romance thing. I reach out to touch his cheek and he catches my hand and presses it against his lips. I remember my father doing this very thing to my mother and I wonder where Peeta picked it up. Surely not from his father and the witch.  ""No more kisses for you until you've eaten,"" I say.  We get him propped up against the wall and he obediently swallows the spoonfuls of the berry mush I feed him. He refuses the groosling again, though.  ""You didn't sleep,"" Peeta says.  ""I'm all right,"" I say. But the truth is, I'm exhausted.  ""Sleep now. I'll keep watch. I'll wake you if anything happens,"" he says. I hesitate. ""Katniss, you can't stay up forever.""  He's got a point there. I'll have to sleep eventually. And probably better to do it now when he seems relatively alert and we have daylight on our side. ""All right,"" I say. ""But just for a few hours. Then you wake me.""  It's too warm for the sleeping bag now. I smooth it out on the cave floor and lie down, one hand on my loaded bow in case I have to shoot at a moment's notice. Peeta sits beside me, leaning against the wall, his bad leg stretched out before him, his eyes trained on the world outside. ""Go to sleep,"" he says softly. His hand brushes the loose strands of my hair off my forehead. Unlike the staged kisses and caresses so far, this gesture seems natural and comforting. I don't want him to stop and he doesn't. He's still stroking my hair when I fall asleep.  Too long. I sleep too long. I know from the moment I open my eyes that we're into the afternoon. Peeta's right beside me, his position unchanged. I sit up, feeling somehow defensive but better rested than I've been in days.  ""Peeta, you were supposed to wake me after a couple of hours,"" I say.  ""For what? Nothing's going on here,"" he says. ""Besides I like watching you sleep. You don't scowl. Improves your looks a lot.""  This, of course, brings on a scowl that makes him grin. That's when I notice how dry his lips are. I test his cheek. Hot as a coal stove. He claims he's been drinking, but the containers still feel full to me. I give him more fever pills and stand over him while he drinks first one, then a second quart of water. Then I tend to his minor wounds, the burns, the stings, which are showing improvement. I steel myself and unwrap the leg.  My heart drops into my stomach. It's worse, much worse. There's no more pus in evidence, but the swelling has increased and the tight shiny skin is inflamed. Then I see the red streaks starting to crawl up his leg. Blood poisoning. Unchecked, it will kill him for sure. My chewed-up leaves and ointment won't make a dent in it. We'll need strong anti-infection drugs from the Capitol. I can't imagine the cost of such potent medicine. If Haymitch pooled every donation from every sponsor, would he have enough? I doubt it. Gifts go up in price the longer the Games continue. What buys a full meal on day one buys a cracker on day twelve. And the kind of medicine Peeta needs would have been at a premium from the beginning.  ""Well, there's more swelling, but the pus is gone,"" I say in an unsteady voice.  ""I know what blood poisoning is, Katniss,"" says Peeta. ""Even if my mother isn't a healer.""  ""You're just going to have to outlast the others, Peeta. They'll cure it back at the Capitol when we win,"" I say.  ""Yes, that's a good plan,"" he says. But I feel this is mostly for my benefit.  ""You have to eat. Keep your strength up. I'm going to make you soup,"" I say.  ""Don't light a fire,"" he says. ""It's not worth it.""  ""We'll see,"" I say. As I take the pot down to the stream, I'm struck by how brutally hot it is. I swear the Gamemakers are progressively ratcheting up the temperature in the daytime and sending it plummeting at night. The heat of the sun-baked stones by the stream gives me an idea though. Maybe I won't need to light a fire.  I settle down on a big flat rock halfway between the stream and the cave. After purifying half a pot of water, I place it in direct sunlight and add several egg-size hot stones to the water. I'm the first to admit I'm not much of a cook. But since soup mainly involves tossing everything in a pot and waiting, it's one of my better dishes. I mince groosling until it's practically mush and mash some of Rue's roots. Fortunately, they've both been roasted already so they mostly need to be heated up. Already, between the sunlight and the rocks, the water's warm. I put in the meat and roots, swap in fresh rocks, and go find something green to spice it up a little. Before long, I discover a tuft of chives growing at the base of some rocks. Perfect. I chop them very fine and add them to the pot, switch out the rocks again, put on the lid, and let the whole thing stew.  I've seen very few signs of game around, but I don't feel comfortable leaving Peeta alone while I hunt, so I rig half a dozen snares and hope I get lucky. I wonder about the other tributes, how they're managing now that their main source of food has been blown up. At least three of them, Cato, Clove, and Foxface, had been relying on it. Probably not Thresh though. I've got a feeling he must share some of Rue's knowledge on how to feed yourself from the earth. Are they fighting each other? Looking for us? Maybe one of them has located us and is just waiting for the right moment to attack. The idea sends me back to the cave.  Peeta's stretched out on top of the sleeping bag in the shade of the rocks. Although he brightens a bit when I come in, it's clear he feels miserable. I put cool cloths on his head, but they warm up almost as soon as they touch his skin.  ""Do you want anything?"" I ask.  ""No,"" he says. ""Thank you. Wait, yes. Tell me a story.""  ""A story? What about?"" I say. I'm not much for storytelling. It's kind of like singing. But once in a while, Prim wheedles one out of me.  ""Something happy. Tell me about the happiest day you can remember,"" says Peeta.  Something between a sigh and a huff of exasperation leaves my mouth. A happy story? This will require a lot more effort than the soup. I rack my brains for good memories. Most of them involve Gale and me out hunting and somehow I don't think these will play well with either Peeta or the audience. That leaves Prim.  ""Did I ever tell you about how I got Prim's goat?"" I ask. Peeta shakes his head, and looks at me expectantly. So I begin. But carefully. Because my words are going out all over Panem. And while people have no doubt put two and two together that I hunt illegally, I don't want to hurt Gale or Greasy Sae or the butcher or even the Peacekeepers back home who are my customers by publicly announcing they'd breaking the law, too.  Here's the real story of how I got the money for Prim's goat, Lady. It was a Friday evening, the day before Prim's tenth birthday in late May. As soon as school ended, Gale and I hit the woods, because I wanted to get enough to trade for a present for Prim. Maybe some new cloth for a dress or a hairbrush. Our snares had done well enough and the woods were flush with greens, but this was really no more than our average Friday-night haul. I was disappointed as we headed back, even though Gale said we'd be sure to do better tomorrow. We were resting a moment by a stream when we saw him. A young buck, probably a yearling by his size. His antlers were just growing in, still small and coated in velvet. Poised to run but unsure of us, unfamiliar with humans. Beautiful.  Less beautiful perhaps when the two arrows caught him, one in the neck, the other in the chest. Gale and I had shot at the same time. The buck tried to run but stumbled, and Gale's knife slit his throat before he knew what had happened. Momentarily, I'd felt a pang at killing something so fresh and innocent. And then my stomach rumbled at the thought of all that fresh and innocent meat.  A deer! Gale and I have only brought down three in all. The first one, a doe that had injured her leg somehow, almost didn't count. But we knew from that experience not to go dragging the carcass into the Hob. It had caused chaos with people bidding on parts and actually trying to hack off pieces themselves. Greasy Sae had intervened and sent us with our deer to the butcher, but not before it'd been badly damaged, hunks of meat taken, the hide riddled with holes. Although everybody paid up fairly, it had lowered the value of the kill.  This time, we waited until dark fell and slipped under a hole in the fence close to the butcher. Even though we were known hunters, it wouldn't have been good to go carrying a 150-pound deer through the streets of District 12 in daylight like we were rubbing it in the officials' faces.  The butcher, a short, chunky woman named Rooba, came to the back door when we knocked. You don't haggle with Rooba. She gives you one price, which you can take or leave, but it's a fair price. We took her offer on the deer and she threw in a couple of venison steaks we could pick up after the butchering. Even with the money divided in two, neither Gale nor I had held so much at one time in our lives. We decided to keep it a secret and surprise our families with the meat and money at the end of the next day.  This is where I really got the money for the goat, but I tell Peeta I sold an old silver locket of my mother's. That can't hurt anyone. Then I pick up the story in the late afternoon of Prim's birthday.  Gale and I went to the market on the square so that I could buy dress materials. As I was running my fingers over a length of thick blue cotton cloth, something caught my eye. There's an old man who keeps a small herd of goats on the other side of the Seam. I don't know his real name, everyone just calls him the Goat Man. His joints are swollen and twisted in painful angles, and he's got a hacking cough that proves he spent years in the mines. But he's lucky. Somewhere along the way he saved up enough for these goats and now has something to do in his old age besides slowly starve to death. He's filthy and impatient, but the goats are clean and their milk is rich if you can afford it.  One of the goats, a white one with black patches, was lying down in a cart. It was easy to see why. Something, probably a dog, had mauled her shoulder and infection had set in. It was bad, the Goat Man had to hold her up to milk her. But I thought I knew someone who could fix it.  ""Gale,"" I whispered. ""I want that goat for Prim.""  Owning a nanny goat can change your life in District 12. The animals can live off almost anything, the Meadow's a perfect feeding place, and they can give four quarts of milk a day. To drink, to make into cheese, to sell. It's not even against the law.  ""She's hurt pretty bad,"" said Gale. ""We better take a closer look.""  We went over and bought a cup of milk to share, then stood over the goat as if idly curious.  ""Let her be,"" said the man.  ""Just looking,"" said Gale.  ""Well, look fast. She goes to the butcher soon. Hardly anyone will buy her milk, and then they only pay half price,"" said the man.  ""What's the butcher giving for her?"" I asked.  The man shrugged. ""Hang around and see."" I turned and saw Rooba coming across the square toward us. ""Lucky thing you showed up,"" said the Goat Man when she arrived. ""Girl's got her eye on your goat.""  ""Not if she's spoken for,"" I said carelessly.  Rooba looked me up and down then frowned at the goat. ""She's not. Look at that shoulder. Bet you half the carcass will be too rotten for even sausage.""  ""What?"" said the Goat Man. ""We had a deal.""  ""We had a deal on an animal with a few teeth marks. Not that thing. Sell her to the girl if she's stupid enough to take her,"" said Rooba. As she marched off, I caught her wink.  The Goat Man was mad, but he still wanted that goal off his hands. It took us half an hour to agree on the price. Quite a crowd had gathered by then to hand out opinions. It was an excellent deal if the goat lived; I'd been robbed if she died. People took sides in the argument, but I took the goat.  Gale offered to carry her. I think he wanted to see the look on Prim's face as much as I did. In a moment of complete giddiness, I bought a pink ribbon and tied it around her neck. Then we hurried back to my house.  You should have seen Prim's reaction when we walked in with that goat. Remember this is a girl who wept to save that awful old cat, Buttercup. She was so excited she started crying and laughing all at once. My mother was less sure, seeing the injury, but the pair of them went to work on it, grinding up herbs and coaxing brews down the animal's throat.  ""They sound like you,"" says Peeta. I had almost forgotten he was there.  ""Oh, no, Peeta. They work magic. That thing couldn't have died if it tried,"" I say. But then I bite my tongue, realizing what that must sound like to Peeta, who is dying, in my incompetent hands.  ""Don't worry. I'm not trying,"" he jokes. ""Finish the story.""  ""Well, that's it. Only I remember that night, Prim insisted on sleeping with Lady on a blanket next to the fire. And just before they drifted off, the goat licked her cheek, like it was giving her a good night kiss or something,"" I say. ""It was already mad about her.""  ""Was it still wearing the pink ribbon?"" he asks.  ""I think so,"" I say. ""Why?""  ""I'm just trying to get a picture,"" he says thoughtfully. ""I can see why that day made you happy.""  ""Well, I knew that goat would be a little gold mine,"" 1 say.  ""Yes, of course I was referring to that, not the lasting joy you gave the sister you love so much you took her place in the reaping,"" says Peeta drily.  ""The goat has paid for itself. Several times over,"" I say in a superior tone.  ""Well, it wouldn't dare do anything else after you saved its life,"" says Peeta. ""I intend to do the same thing.""  ""Really? What did you cost me again?"" I ask.  ""A lot of trouble. Don't worry. You'll get it all back,"" he says.  ""You're not making sense,"" I say. I test his forehead. The lever's going nowhere but up. ""You're a little cooler though.""  The sound of the trumpets startles me. I'm on my feet and at the mouth of the cave in a flash, not wanting to miss a syllable. It's my new best friend, Claudius Templesmith, and as I expected, he's inviting us to a feast. Well, we're not that hungry and I actually wave his offer away in indifference when he says, ""Now hold on. Some of you may already be declining my invitation. But this is no ordinary feast. Each of you needs something desperately.""  I do need something desperately. Something to heal Peeta's leg.  ""Each of you will find that something in a backpack, marked with your district number, at the Cornucopia at dawn. Think hard about refusing to show up. For some of you, this will be your last chance,"" says Claudius.  There's nothing else, just his words hanging in the air. I jump as Peeta grips my shoulder from behind. ""No,"" he says. ""You're not risking your life for me.""  ""Who said I was?"" I say.  ""So, you're not going?"" he asks.  ""Of course, I'm not going. Give me some credit. Do you think I'm running straight into some free-for-all against Cato and Clove and Thresh? Don't be stupid,"" I say, helping him back to bed. ""I'll let them fight it out, we'll see who's in the sky tomorrow night and work out a plan from there.""  ""You're such a bad liar, Katniss. I don't know how you've survived this long."" He begins to mimic me. ""I knew that goat would be a little gold mine. You're a little cooler though. Of course, I'm not going. He shakes his head. ""Never gamble at cards. You'll lose your last coin,"" he says.  Anger flushes my face. ""All right, I am going, and you can't stop me!""  ""I can follow you. At least partway. I may not make it to the Cornucopia, but if I'm yelling your name, I bet someone can find me. And then I'll be dead for sure,"" he says.  ""You won't get a hundred yards from here on that leg,"" I say.  ""Then I'll drag myself,"" says Peeta. ""You go and I'm going, too.""  He's just stubborn enough and maybe just strong enough to do it. Come howling after me in the woods. Even if a tribute doesn't find him, something else might. He can't defend himself. I'd probably have to wall him up in the cave just to go myself. And who knows what the exertion will do to him?  ""What am I supposed to do? Sit here and watch you die?"" I say. He must know that's not an option. That the audience would hate me. And frankly, I would hate myself, too, if I didn't even try.  ""I won't die. I promise. If you promise not to go,"" he says.  We're at something of a stalemate. I know I can't argue him out of this one, so I don't try. I pretend, reluctantly, to go along. ""Then you have to do what I say. Drink your water, wake me when I tell you, and eat every bite of the soup no matter how disgusting it is!"" I snap at him.  ""Agreed. Is it ready?"" he asks.  ""Wait here,"" I say. The air's gone cold even though the sun's still up. I'm right about the Gamemakers messing with the temperature. I wonder if the thing someone needs desperately is a good blanket. The soup is still nice and warm in its iron pot. And actually doesn't taste too bad.  Peeta eats without complaint, even scraping out the pot to show his enthusiasm. He rambles on about how delicious it is, which should be encouraging if you don't know what fever does to people. He's like listening to Haymitch before the alcohol has soaked him into incoherence. I give him another dose of fever medicine before he goes off his head completely.  As I go down to the stream to wash up, all I can think is that he's going to die if I don't get to that feast. I'll keep him going for a day or two, and then the infection will reach his heart or his brain or his lungs and he'll be gone. And I'll be here all alone. Again. Waiting for the others.  I'm so lost in thought that I almost miss the parachute, even though it floats right by me. Then I spring after it, yanking it from the water, tearing off the silver fabric to retrieve the vial. Haymitch has done it! He's gotten the medicine  -  I don't know how, persuaded some gaggle of romantic fools to sell their jewels  -  and I can save Peeta! It's such a tiny vial though. It must be very strong to cure someone as ill as Peeta. A ripple of doubt runs through me. I uncork the vial and take a deep sniff. My spirits fall at the sickly sweet scent. Just to be sure, I place a drop on the tip of my tongue. There's no question, it's sleep syrup. It's a common medicine in District 12. Cheap, as medicine goes, but very addictive. Almost everyone's had a dose at one time or another. We have some in a bottle at home. My mother gives it to hysterical patients to knock them out to stitch up a bad wound or quiet their minds or just to help someone in pain get through the night. It only takes a little. A vial this size could knock Peeta out for a full day, but what good is that? I'm so furious I'm about to throw Haymitch's last offering into the stream when it hits me. A full day? That's more than I need.  I mash up a handful of berries so the taste won't be as noticeable and add some mint leaves for good measure. Then I head back up to the cave. ""I've brought you a treat. I found a new patch of berries a little farther downstream.""  Peeta opens his mouth for the first bite without hesitation. He swallows then frowns slightly. ""They're very sweet.""  ""Yes, they're sugar berries. My mother makes jam from them. Haven't you ever had them before?"" I say, poking the next spoonful in his mouth.  ""No,"" he says, almost puzzled. ""But they taste familiar. Sugar berries?""  ""Well, you can't get them in the market much, they only grow wild,"" I say. Another mouthful goes down. Just one more to go.  ""They're sweet as syrup,"" he says, taking the last spoonful. ""Syrup."" His eyes widen as he realizes the truth. I clamp my hand over his mouth and nose hard, forcing him to swallow instead of spit. He tries to make himself vomit the stuff up, but it's too late, he's already losing consciousness. Even as he fades away, I can see in his eyes what I've done is unforgivable.  I sit back on my heels and look at him with a mixture of sadness and satisfaction. A stray berry stains his chin and I wipe it away. ""Who can't lie, Peeta?"" I say, even though he can't hear me.  It doesn't matter. The rest of Panem can."
Hunger Games Chapter 21,"In the remaining hours before nightfall, I gather rocks and do my best to camouflage the opening of the cave. It's a slow and arduous process, but after a lot of sweating and shifting things around, I'm pretty pleased with my work, The cave now appears to be part of a larger pile of rocks, like so many in the vicinity. I can still crawl in to Peeta through a small opening, but it's undetectable from the out side. That's good, because I'll need to share that sleeping bag again tonight. Also, if I don't make it back from the feast, Peeta will be hidden but not entirely imprisoned. Although I doubt he can hang on much longer without medicine. If I die at the feast, District 12 isn't likely to have a victor.  I make a meal out of the smaller, bonier fish that inhabit the stream down here, fill every water container and purify it, and clean my weapons. I've nine arrows left in all. I debate leaving the knife with Peeta so he'll have some protection while I'm gone, but there's really no point. He was right about camouflage being his final defense. But I still might have use for the knife. Who knows what I'll encounter?  Here are some things I'm fairly certain of. That at least Cato, Clove, and Thresh will be on hand when the feast starts. I'm not sure about Foxface since direct confrontation isn't her style or her forte. She's even smaller than I am and unarmed, unless she's picked up some weapons recently. She'll probably be hanging somewhere nearby, seeing what she can scavenge. But the other three. I'm going to have my hands full. My ability to kill at a distance is my greatest asset, but I know I'll have to go right into the thick of things to get that backpack, the one with the number 12 on it that Claudius Templesmith mentioned.  I watch the sky, hoping for one less opponent at dawn, but nobody appears tonight. Tomorrow there will be faces up there. Feasts always result in fatalities.  I crawl into the cave, secure my glasses, and curl up next to Peeta. Luckily I had that good long sleep today. I have to stay awake. I don't really think anyone will attack our cave tonight, but I can't risk missing the dawn.  So cold, so bitterly cold tonight. As if the Gamemakers have sent an infusion of frozen air across the arena, which may be exactly what they've done. I lay next to Peeta in the bag, trying to absorb every bit of his fever heat. It's strange to be so physically close to someone who's so distant. Peeta might as well be back in the Capitol, or in District 12, or on the moon right now, he'd be no harder to reach. I've never felt lonelier since the Games began.  Just accept it will be a bad night, I tell myself. I try not to, but I can't help thinking of my mother and Prim, wondering if they'll sleep a wink tonight. At this late stage in the Games, with an important event like the feast, school will probably be canceled. My family can either watch on that static-filled old clunker of a television at home or join the crowds in the square to watch on the big, clear screens, They'll have privacy at home but support in the square. People will give them a kind word, a bit of food if they can spare it. I wonder if the baker has sought them out, especially now that Peeta and I are a team, and made good on his promise to keep my sister's belly full.  Spirits must be running high in District 12. We so rarely have anyone to root for at this point in the Games. Surely, people are excited about Peeta and me, especially now that we're together. If I close my eyes, I can imagine their shouts at the screens, urging us on. I see their faces  -  Greasy Sac and Madge and even the Peacekeepers who buy my meat cheering for us.  And Gale. I know him. He won't be shouting and cheering. But he'll be watching, every moment, every twist and turn, and willing me to come home. I wonder if he's hoping that Peeta makes it as well. Gale's not my boyfriend, but would he be, if I opened that door? He talked about us running away together. Was that just a practical calculation of our chances of survival away from the district? Or something more?  I wonder what he makes of all this kissing.  Through a crack in the rocks, I watch the moon cross the sky. At what I judge to be about three hours before dawn, I begin final preparations. I'm careful to leave Peeta with water and the medical kit right beside him. Nothing else will be of much use if I don't return, and even these would only prolong his life a short time. After some debate, I strip him of his jacket and zip it on over my own. He doesn't need it. Not now in the sleeping bag with his fever, and during the day, if I'm not there to remove it, he'll be roasting in it. My hands are already stiff from cold, so I take Rue's spare pair of socks, cut holes for my fingers and thumbs, and pull them on. It helps anyway. I fill her small pack with some food, a water bottle, and bandages, tuck the knife in my belt, get my bow and arrows. I'm about to leave when I remember the importance of sustaining the star-crossed lover routine and I lean over and give Peeta a long, lingering kiss. I imagine the teary sighs emanating from the Capitol and pretend to brush away a tear of my own. Then I squeeze through the opening in the rocks out into the night.  My breath makes small white clouds as it hits the air. It's as cold as a November night at home. One where I've slipped into the woods, lantern in hand, to join Gale at some prearranged place where we'll sit bundled together, sipping herb tea from metal flasks wrapped in quilting, hoping game will pass our way as the morning comes on. Oh, Gale, I think. If only you had my back now.  I move as fast as I dare. The glasses are quite remarkable, but I still sorely miss having the use of my left ear. I don't know what the explosion did, but it damaged something deep and irreparable. Never mind. If I get home, I'll be so stinking rich, I'll be able to pay someone to do my hearing.  The woods always look different at night. Even with the glasses, everything has an unfamiliar slant to it. As if the daytime trees and flowers and stones had gone to bed and sent slightly more ominous versions of themselves to take their places. I don't try anything tricky, like taking a new route. I make my way back up the stream and follow the same path back to Rue's hiding place near the lake. Along the way, I see no sign of another tribute, not a puff of breath, not a quiver of a branch. Either I'm the first to arrive or the others positioned themselves last night. There's still more than an hour, maybe two, when I wriggle into the underbrush and wait for the blood to begin to flow.  I chew a few mint leaves, my stomach isn't up for much more. Thank goodness, I have Peeta's jacket as well as my own. If not, I'd be forced to move around to stay warm. The sky turns a misty morning gray and still there's no sign of the other tributes. It's not surprising really. Everyone has distinguished themselves either by strength or deadliness or cunning. Do they suppose, I wonder, that I have Peeta with me? I doubt Foxface and Thresh even know he was wounded. All the better if they think he's covering me when I go in for the backpack.  But where is it? The arena has lightened enough for me to remove my glasses. I can hear the morning birds singing. Isn't it time? For a second, I'm panicked that I'm at the wrong location. But no, I'm certain I remember Claudius Templesmith specifying the Cornucopia. And there it is. And here I am. So where's my feast?  Just as the first ray of sun glints off the gold Cornucopia, there's a disturbance on the plain. The ground before the mouth of the horn splits in two and a round table with a snowy white cloth rises into the arena. On the table sit four backpacks, two large black ones with the numbers 2 and 11, a medium-size green one with the number 5, and a tiny orange one  -  really I could carry it around my wrist  -  that must be marked with a 12.  The table has just clicked into place when a figure darts out of the Cornucopia, snags the green backpack, and speeds off. Foxface! Leave it to her to come up with such a clever and risky idea! The rest of us are still poised around the plain, sizing up the situation, and she's got hers. She's got us trapped, too, because no one wants to chase her down, not while their own pack sits so vulnerable on the table. Foxface must have purposefully left the other packs alone, knowing that to steal one without her number would definitely bring on a pursuer. That should have been my strategy! By the lime I've worked through the emotions of surprise, admiration, anger, jealousy, and frustration, I'm watching that reddish mane of hair disappear into the trees well out of shooting range. Huh. I'm always dreading the others, but maybe Foxface is the real opponent here.  She's cost me time, too, because by now it's clear that I must get to the table next. Anyone who beats me to it will easily scoop up my pack and be gone. Without hesitation, I sprint for the table. I can sense the emergence of danger before I see it. Fortunately, the first knife comes whizzing in on my right side so I can hear it and I'm able to deflect it with my bow. I turn, drawing back the bowstring and send an arrow straight at Clove's heart. She turns just enough to avoid a fatal hit, but the point punctures her upper left arm. Unfortunately, she throws with her right, but it's enough to slow her down a few moments, having to pull the arrow from her arm, take in the severity of the wound. I keep moving, positioning the next arrow automatically, as only someone who has hunted for years can do.  I'm at the table now, my fingers closing over the tiny orange backpack. My hand slips between the straps and I yank it up on my arm, it's really too small to fit on any other part of my anatomy, and I'm turning to fire again when the second knife catches me in the forehead. It slices above my right eyebrow, opening a gash that sends a gush running down my face, blinding my eye, filling my mouth with the sharp, metallic taste of my own blood. I stagger backward but still manage to send my readied arrow in the general direction of my assailant. I know as it leaves my hands it will miss. And then Clove slams into me, knocking me flat on my back, pinning my shoulders to the ground, with her knees.  This is it, I think, and hope for Prim's sake it will be fast. But Clove means to savor the moment. Even feels she has time. No doubt Cato is somewhere nearby, guarding her, waiting for Thresh and possibly Peeta.  ""Where's your boyfriend, District Twelve? Still hanging on?"" she asks.  Well, as long as we're talking I'm alive. ""He's out there now. Hunting Cato,"" I snarl at her. Then I scream at the top of my lungs. ""Peeta!""  Clove jams her fist into my windpipe, very effectively cutting off my voice. But her head's whipping from side to side, and I know for a moment she's at least considering I'm telling the truth. Since no Peeta appears to save me, she turns back to me.  ""Liar,"" she says with a grin. ""He's nearly dead. Cato knows where he cut him. You've probably got him strapped up in some tree while you try to keep his heart going. What's in the pretty little backpack? That medicine for Lover Boy? Too bad he'll never get it.""  Clove opens her jacket. It's lined with an impressive array of knives. She carefully selects an almost dainty-looking number with a cruel, curved blade. ""I promised Cato if he let me have you, I'd give the audience a good show.""  I'm struggling now in an effort to unseat her, but it's no use. She's too heavy and her lock on me too tight.  ""Forget it, District Twelve. We're going to kill you. Just like we did your pathetic little ally. what was her name? The one who hopped around in the trees? Rue? Well, first Rue, then you, and then I think we'll just let nature take care of Lover Boy. How does that sound?"" Clove asks. ""Now, where to start?""  She carelessly wipes away the blood from my wound with her jacket sleeve. For a moment, she surveys my face, tilting it from side to side as if it's a block of wood and she's deciding exactly what pattern to carve on it. I attempt to bite her hand, but she grabs the hair on the top of my head, forcing me back to the ground. ""I think. "" she almost purrs. ""I think we'll start with your mouth."" I clamp my teeth together as she teasingly traces the outline of my lips with the tip of the blade.  I won't close my eyes. The comment about Rue has filled me with fury, enough fury I think to die with some dignity. As my last act of defiance, I will stare her down as long as I can see, which will probably not be an extended period of time, but I will stare her down, I will not cry out. I will die, in my own small way, undefeated.  ""Yes, I don't think you'll have much use for your lips anymore. Want to blow Lover Boy one last kiss?"" she asks, I work up a mouthful of blood and saliva and spit it in her face. She flushes with rage. ""All right then. Let's get started.""  I brace myself for the agony that's sure to follow. But as I feel the tip open the first cut at my lip, some great form yanks Clove from my body and then she's screaming. I'm too stunned at first, too unable to process what has happened. Has Peeta somehow come to my rescue? Have the Gamemakers sent in some wild animal to add to the fun? Has a hovercraft inexplicably plucked her into the air?  But when I push myself up on my numb arms, I see it's none of the above. Clove is dangling a foot off the ground, imprisoned in Thresh's arms. I let out a gasp, seeing him like that, towering over me, holding Clove like a rag doll. I remember him as big, but he seems more massive, more powerful than I even recall. If anything, he seems to have gained weight in the arena. He flips Clove around and flings her onto the ground.  When he shouts, I jump, never having heard him speak above a mutter. ""What'd you do to that little girl? You kill her?""  Clove is scrambling backward on all fours, like a frantic insect, too shocked to even call for Cato. ""No! No, it wasn't me!""  ""You said her name. I heard you. You kill her?"" Another thought brings a fresh wave of rage to his features. ""You cut her up like you were going to cut up this girl here?""  ""No! No, I  - "" Clove sees the stone, about the size of a small loaf of bread in Thresh's hand and loses it. ""Cato!"" she screeches. ""Cato!""  ""Clove!"" I hear Cato's answer, but he's too far away, I can tell that much, to do her any good. What was he doing? Trying to get Foxface or Peeta? Or had he been lying in wait for Thresh and just badly misjudged his location?  Thresh brings the rock down hard against Clove's temple. It's not bleeding, but I can see the dent in her skull and I know that she's a goner. There's still life in her now though, in the rapid rise and fall of her chest, the low moan escaping her lips.  When Thresh whirls around on me, the rock raised, I know it's no good to run. And my bow is empty, the last loaded arrow having gone in Clove's direction. I'm trapped in the glare of his strange golden brown eyes. ""What'd she mean? About Rue being your ally?""  ""I - I  -  we teamed up. Blew up the supplies. I tried to save her, I did. But he got there first. District One,"" I say. Maybe if he knows I helped Rue, he won't choose some slow, sadistic end for me.  ""And you killed him?"" he demands.  ""Yes. I killed him. And buried her in flowers,"" I say. ""And I sang her to sleep.""  Tears spring in my eyes. The tension, the fight goes out of me at the memory. And I'm overwhelmed by Rue, and the pain in my head, and my fear of Thresh, and the moaning of the dying girl a few feet away.  ""To sleep?"" Thresh says gruffly.  ""To death. I sang until she died,"" I say. ""Your district. they sent me bread."" My hand reaches up but not for an arrow that I know I'll never reach. Just to wipe my nose. ""Do it fast, okay, Thresh?""  Conflicting emotions cross Thresh's face. He lowers the rock and points at me, almost accusingly. ""Just this one time, I let you go. For the little girl. You and me, we're even then. No more owed. You understand?""  I nod because I do understand. About owing. About hating it. I understand that if Thresh wins, he'll have to go back and face a district that has already broken all the rules to thank me, and he is breaking the rules to thank me, too. And I understand that, for the moment, Thresh is not going to smash in my skull.  ""Clove!"" Cato's voice is much nearer now. I can tell by the pain in it that he sees her on the ground.  ""You better run now, Fire Girl,"" says Thresh.  I don't need to be told twice. I flip over and my feet dip into the hard-packed earth as I run away from Thresh and Clove and the sound of Cato's voice. Only when I reach the woods do I turn back for an instant. Thresh and both large backpacks are vanishing over the edge of the plain into the area I've never seen. Cato kneels beside Clove, spear in hand, begging her to stay with him. In a moment, he will realize it's futile, she can't be saved. I crash into the trees, repeatedly swiping away the blood that's pouring into my eye, fleeing like the wild, wounded creature I am. After a few minutes, I hear the cannon and I know that Clove has died, that Cato will be on one of our trails. Either Thresh's or mine. I'm seized with terror, weak from my head wound, shaking. I load an arrow, but Cato can throw that spear almost as far as I can shoot.  Only one thing calms me down. Thresh has Cato's backpack containing the thing he needs desperately. If I had to bet, Cato headed out after Thresh, not me. Still I don't slow down when I reach the water. I plunge right in, boots still on, and flounder downstream. I pull off Rue's socks that I've been using for gloves and press them into my forehead, trying to staunch the flow of blood, but they're soaked in minutes.  Somehow I make it back to the cave. I squeeze through the rocks. In the dappled light, I pull the little orange backpack from my arm, cut open the clasp, and dump the contents on the ground. One slim box containing one hypodermic needle. Without hesitating, I jam the needle into Peeta's arm and slowly press down on the plunger.  My hands go to my head and then drop to my lap, slick with blood.  The last thing I remember is an exquisitely beautiful green-and-silver moth landing on the curve of my wrist."
Hunger Games Chapter 22,"The sound of rain drumming on the roof of our house gently pulls me toward consciousness. I fight to return to sleep though, wrapped in a warm cocoon of blankets, safe at home. I'm vaguely aware that my head aches. Possibly I have the flu and this is why I'm allowed to stay in bed, even though I can tell I've been asleep a long time. My mother's hand strokes my cheek and I don't push it away as I would in wakefulness, never wanting her to know how much I crave that gentle touch. How much I miss her even though I still don't trust her. Then there's a voice, the wrong voice, not my mother's, and I'm scared.  ""Katniss,"" it says. ""Katniss, can you hear me?""  My eyes open and the sense of security vanishes. I'm not home, not with my mother. I'm in a dim, chilly cave, my bare feet freezing despite the cover, the air tainted with the unmistakable smell of blood. The haggard, pale face of a boy slides into view, and after an initial jolt of alarm, I feel better. ""Peeta.""  ""Hey,"" he says. ""Good to see your eyes again.""  ""How long have I been out?"" I ask.  ""Not sure. I woke up yesterday evening and you were lying next to me in a very scary pool of blood,"" he says. ""I think it's stopped finally, but I wouldn't sit up or anything.""  I gingerly lift my hand to my head and find it bandaged. This simple gesture leaves me weak and dizzy. Peeta holds a bottle to my lips and I drink thirstily.  ""You're better,"" I say.  ""Much better. Whatever you shot into my arm did the trick,"" he says. ""By this morning, almost all the swelling in my leg was gone.""  He doesn't seem angry about my tricking him, drugging him, and running off to the feast. Maybe I'm just too beat-up and I'll hear about it later when I'm stronger. But for the moment, he's all gentleness.  ""Did you eat?"" I ask.  ""I'm sorry to say I gobbled down three pieces of that groosling before I realized it might have to last a while. Don't worry, I'm back on a strict diet,"" he says.  ""No, it's good. You need to eat. I'll go hunting soon,"" I say.  ""Not too soon, all right?"" he says. ""You just let me take care of you for a while.""  I don't really seem to have much choice. Peeta feeds me bites of groosling and raisins and makes me drink plenty of water. He rubs some warmth back into my feet and wraps them in his jacket before tucking the sleeping bag back up around my chin.  ""Your boots and socks are still damp and the weather's not helping much,"" he says. There's a clap of thunder, and I see lightning electrify the sky through an opening in the rocks. Rain drips through several holes in the ceiling, but Peeta has built a sort of canopy over my head an upper body by wedging the square of plastic into the rock above me.  ""I wonder what brought on this storm? I mean, who's the target?"" says Peeta.  ""Cato and Thresh,"" I say without thinking. ""Foxface will be in her den somewhere, and Clove. she cut me an then. "" My voice trails off.  ""I know Clove's dead. I saw it in the sky last night,"" h says. ""Did you kill her?""  ""No. Thresh broke her skull with a rock,"" I say.  ""Lucky he didn't catch you, too,"" says Peeta.  The memory of the feast returns full-force and I feel sick. ""He did. But he let me go."" Then, of course, I have to tell him. About things I've kept to myself because he was too sick to ask and I wasn't ready to relive anyway. Like the explosion and my ear and Rue's dying and the boy from District 1 and the bread. All of which leads to what happened with Thresh and how he was paying off a debt of sorts.  ""He let you go because he didn't want to owe you anything?"" asks Peeta in disbelief.  ""Yes. I don't expect you to understand it. You've always had enough. But if you'd lived in the Seam, I wouldn't have to explain,"" I say.  ""And don't try. Obviously I'm too dim to get it.""  ""It's like the bread. How I never seem to get over owing you for that,"" I say.  ""The bread? What? From when we were kids?"" he says. ""I think we can let that go. I mean, you just brought me back from the dead.""  ""But you didn't know me. We had never even spoken. Besides, it's the first gift that's always the hardest to pay back. I wouldn't even have been here to do it if you hadn't helped me then,"" I say. ""Why did you, anyway?""  ""Why? You know why,"" Peeta says. I give my head a slight, painful shake. ""Haymitch said you would take a lot of convincing.""  ""Haymitch?"" I ask. ""What's he got to do with it?""  ""Nothing,"" Peeta says. ""So, Cato and Thresh, huh? I guess it's too much to hope that they'll simultaneously destroy each other?""  But the thought only upsets me. ""I think we would like Thresh. I think he'd be our friend back in District Twelve,"" I say.  ""Then let's hope Cato kills him, so we don't have to,"" says Peeta grimly.  I don't want Cato to kill Thresh at all. I don't want anyone else to die. But this is absolutely not the kind of thing that victors go around saying in the arena. Despite my best efforts, I can feel tears starting to pool in my eyes.  Peeta looks at me in concern. ""What is it? Are you in a lot of pain?""  I give him another answer, because it is equally true but can be taken as a brief moment of weakness instead of a terminal one. ""I want to go home, Peeta,"" I say plaintively, like a small child.  ""You will. I promise,"" he says, and bends over to give me a kiss.  ""I want to go home now,"" I say.  ""Tell you what. You go back to sleep and dream of home. And you'll be there for real before you know it,"" lie says. ""Okay?""  ""Okay,"" I whisper. ""Wake me if you need me to keep watch.""  ""I'm good and rested, thanks to you and Haymitch. Besides, who knows how long this will last?"" he says.  What does he mean? The storm? The brief respite ii brings us? The Games themselves? I don't know, but I'm ion sad and tired to ask.  It's evening when Peeta wakes me again. The rain has turned to a downpour, sending streams of water through our ceiling where earlier there had been only drips. Peeta has placed the broth pot under the worst one and repositioned the plastic to deflect most of it from me. I feel a bit better, able to sit up without getting too dizzy, and I'm absolutely famished. So is Peeta. It's clear he's been waiting for me to wake up to eat and is eager to get started.  There's not much left. Two pieces of groosling, a small mishmash of roots, and a handful of dried fruit.  ""Should we try and ration it?"" Peeta asks.  ""No, let's just finish it. The groosling's getting old anyway, and the last thing we need is to get sick off spoiled food,"" I say, dividing the food into two equal piles. We try and eat slowly, but we're both so hungry were done in a couple of minutes. My stomach is in no way satisfied. ""Tomorrow's a hunting day,"" I say.  ""I won't be much help with that,"" Peeta says. ""I've never hunted before.""  ""I'll kill and you cook,"" I say. ""And you can always gather.""  ""I wish there was some sort of bread bush out there,"" says Peeta.  ""The bread they sent me from District Eleven was still warm,"" I say with a sigh. ""Here, chew these."" I hand him a couple of mint leaves and pop a few in my own mouth.  It's hard to even see the projection in the sky, but it's clear enough to know there were no more deaths today. So Cato and Thresh haven't had it out yet.  ""Where did Thresh go? I mean, what's on the far side of the circle?"" I ask Peeta.  ""A field. As far as you can see it's full of grasses as high as my shoulders. I don't know, maybe some of them are grain. There are patches of different colors. But there are no paths,"" says Peeta.  ""I bet some of them are grain. I bet Thresh knows which ones, too,"" I say. ""Did you go in there?""  ""No. Nobody really wanted to track Thresh down in that grass. It has a sinister feeling to it. Every time I look at that field, all I can think of are hidden things. Snakes, and rabid animals, and quicksand,"" Peeta says. ""There could be anything in there.""  I don't say so but Peeta's words remind me of the warnings they give us about not going beyond the fence in District 12. I can't help, for a moment, comparing him with Gale, who would see that field as a potential source of food as well as a threat. Thresh certainly did. It's not that Peeta's soft exactly, and he's proved he's not a coward. But there are things you don't question too much, I guess, when your home always smells like baking bread, whereas Gale questions everything. What would Peeta think of the irreverent banter that passes between us as we break the law each day? Would it shock him? The things we say about Panem? Gale's tirades against the Capitol?  ""Maybe there is a bread bush in that field,"" I say. ""Maybe that's why Thresh looks better fed now than when we started the Games.""  ""Either that or he's got very generous sponsors,"" says Peeta. ""I wonder what we'd have to do to get Haymitch to send us some bread.""  I raise my eyebrows before I remember he doesn't know about the message Haymitch sent us a couple of nights ago. One kiss equals one pot of broth. It's not the sort of thing I can blurt out, either. To say my thoughts aloud would be tipping off the audience that the romance has been fabricated to play on their sympathies and that would result in no food at all. Somehow, believably, I've got to get things back on track. Something simple to start with. I reach out and take his hand.  ""Well, he probably used up a lot of resources helping me knock you out,"" I say mischievously.  ""Yeah, about that,"" says Peeta, entwining his fingers in mine. ""Don't try something like that again.""  ""Or what?"" I ask.  ""Or. or. "" He can't think of anything good. ""Just give me a minute.""  ""What's the problem?"" I say with a grin.  ""The problem is we're both still alive. Which only reinforces the idea in your mind that you did the right thing,"" says Peeta.  ""I did do the right thing,"" I say.  ""No! Just don't, Katniss!"" His grip tightens, hurting my hand, and there's real anger in his voice. ""Don't die for me. You won't be doing me any favors. All right?""  I'm startled by his intensity but recognize an excellent opportunity for getting food, so I try to keep up. ""Maybe I did it for myself, Peeta, did you ever think of that? Maybe you aren't the only one who. who worries about. what it would be like if. ""  I fumble. I'm not as smooth with words as Peeta. And while I was talking, the idea of actually losing Peeta hit me again and I realized how much I don't want him to die. And it's not about the sponsors. And it's not about what will happen back home. And it's not just that I don't want to be alone. It's him. I do not want to lose the boy with the bread.  ""If what, Katniss?"" he says softly.  I wish I could pull the shutters closed, blocking out this moment from the prying eyes of Panem. Even if it means losing food. Whatever I'm feeling, it's no one's business but mine.  ""That's exactly the kind of topic Haymitch told me to steer clear of,"" I say evasively, although Haymitch never said anything of the kind. In fact, he's probably cursing me out right now for dropping the ball during such an emotionally charged moment. But Peeta somehow catches it.  ""Then I'll just have to fill in the blanks myself,"" he says, and moves in to me.  This is the first kiss that we're both fully aware of. Neither of us hobbled by sickness or pain or simply unconscious. Our lips neither burning with fever or icy cold. This is the first kiss where I actually feel stirring inside my chest. Warm and curious. This is the first kiss that makes me want another.  But I don't get it. Well, I do get a second kiss, but it's just a light one on the tip of my nose because Peeta's been distracted. ""I think your wound is bleeding again. Come on, lie down, it's bedtime anyway,"" he says.  My socks are dry enough to wear now. I make Peeta put his jacket back on. The damp cold seems to cut right down to my bones, so he must be half frozen. I insist on taking the first watch, too, although neither of us think it's likely anyone will come in this weather. But he won't agree unless I'm in the bag, too, and I'm shivering so hard that it's pointless to object. In stark contrast to two nights ago, when I felt Peeta was a million miles away, I'm struck by his immediacy now. As we settle in, he pulls my head down to use his arm as a pillow, the other rests protectively over me even when he goes to sleep. No one has held me like this in such a long time. Since my father died and I stopped trusting my mother, no one else's arms have made me feel this safe.  With the aid of the glasses, I lie watching the drips of water splatter on the cave floor. Rhythmic and lulling. Several times, I drift off briefly and then snap awake, guilty and angry with myself. After three or four hours, I can't help it, I have to rouse Peeta because I can't keep my eyes open. He doesn't seem to mind.  ""Tomorrow, when it's dry, I'll find us a place so high in the trees we can both sleep in peace,"" I promise as I drift off.  But tomorrow is no better in terms of weather. The deluge continues as if the Gamemakers are intent on washing us all away. The thunder's so powerful it seems to shake the ground. Peeta's considering heading out anyway to scavenge for food, but I tell him in this storm it would be pointless. He won't be able to see three feet in front of his face and he'll only end up getting soaked to the skin for his troubles. He knows I'm right, but the gnawing in our stomachs is becoming painful.  The day drags on turning into evening and there's no break in the weather. Haymitch is our only hope, but nothing is forthcoming, either from lack of money  -  everything will cost an exorbitant amount  -  or because he's dissatisfied with our performance. Probably the latter. I'd be the first to admit we're not exactly riveting today. Starving, weak from injuries, trying not to reopen wounds. We're sitting huddled together wrapped in the sleeping bag, yes, but mostly to keep warm. The most exciting thing either of us does is nap.  I'm not really sure how to ramp up the romance. The kiss last night was nice, but working up to another will take some forethought. There are girls in the Seam, some of the merchant girls, too, who navigate these waters so easily. But I've never had much time or use for it. Anyway, just a kiss isn't enough anymore clearly because if it was we'd have gotten food last night. My instincts tell me Haymitch isn't just looking for physical affection, he wants something more personal. The sort of stuff he was trying to get me to tell about myself when we were practicing for the interview. I'm rotten at it, but Peeta's not. Maybe the best approach is to get him talking.  ""Peeta,"" I say lightly. ""You said at the interview you'd had a crush on me forever. When did forever start?""  ""Oh, let's see. I guess the first day of school. We were five. You had on a red plaid dress and your hair. it was in two braids instead of one. My father pointed you out when we were waiting to line up,"" Peeta says.  ""Your father? Why?"" I ask.  ""He said, 'See that little girl? I wanted to marry her mother, but she ran off with a coal miner,'"" Peeta says.  ""What? You're making that up!"" I exclaim.  ""No, true story,"" Peeta says. ""And I said, 'A coal miner? Why did she want a coal miner if she could've had you?' And he said, 'Because when he sings. even the birds stop to listen.'""  ""That's true. They do. I mean, they did,"" I say. I'm stunned and surprisingly moved, thinking of the baker telling this to Peeta. It strikes me that my own reluctance to sing, my own dismissal of music might not really be that I think it's a waste of time. It might be because it reminds me too much of my father.  ""So that day, in music assembly, the teacher asked who knew the valley song. Your hand shot right up in the air. She stood you up on a stool and had you sing it for us. And I swear, every bird outside the windows fell silent,"" Peeta says.  ""Oh, please,"" I say, laughing.  ""No, it happened. And right when your song ended, I knew  -  just like your mother  -  I was a goner,"" Peeta says. ""Then for the next eleven years, I tried to work up the nerve to talk to you.""  ""Without success,"" I add.  ""Without success. So, in a way, my name being drawn in the reaping was a real piece of luck,"" says Peeta.  For a moment, I'm almost foolishly happy and then confusion sweeps over me. Because we're supposed to be making up this stuff, playing at being in love not actually being in love. But Peeta's story has a ring of truth to it. That part about my father and the birds. And I did sing the first day of school, although I don't remember the song. And that red plaid dress. there was one, a hand-me-down to Prim that got washed to rags after my father's death.  It would explain another thing, too. Why Peeta took a beating to give me the bread on that awful hollow day. So, if those details are true. could it all be true?  ""You have a. remarkable memory,"" I say haltingly.  ""I remember everything about you,"" says Peeta, tucking a loose strand of hair behind my ear. ""You're the one who wasn't paying attention.""  ""I am now,"" I say.  ""Well, I don't have much competition here,"" he says.  I want to draw away, to close those shutters again, but I know I can't. It's as if I can hear Haymitch whispering in my ear, ""Say it! Say it!""  I swallow hard and get the words out. ""You don't have much competition anywhere."" And this time, it's me who leans in.  Our lips have just barely touched when the clunk outside makes us jump. My bow comes up, the arrow ready to fly, but there's no other sound. Peeta peers through the rocks and then gives a whoop. Before I can stop him, lie's out in the rain, then handing something in to me. A silver parachute attached to a basket. I rip it open at once and inside there's a feast  -  fresh rolls, goat cheese, apples, and best of all, a tureen of that incredible lamb stew on wild rice. The very dish I told Caesar Flickerman was the most impressive thing the Capitol had to offer.  Peeta wriggles back inside, his face lit up like the sun. ""I guess Haymitch finally got tired of watching us starve.""  ""I guess so,"" I answer.  But in my head I can hear Haymitch's smug, if slightly exasperated, words, ""Yes, that's what I'm looking lot, sweetheart."""
Hunger Games Chapter 23,"Every cell in my body wants me to dig into the stew and cram it, handful by handful into my mouth. But Peeta's voice stops me. ""We better take it slow on that stew. Remember the first night on the train? The rich food made me sick and I wasn't even starving then.""  ""You're right. And I could just inhale the whole thing!"" I say regretfully. But I don't. We are quite sensible. We each have a roll, half an apple, and an egg-size serving of stew and rice. I make myself eat the stew in tiny spoonfuls  -  they even sent us silverware and plates  -  savoring each bite. When we finish, I stare longingly at the dish. ""I want more.""  ""Me, too. Tell you what. We wait an hour, if it stays down, then we get another serving,"" Peeta says.  ""Agreed,"" I say. ""It's going to be a long hour.""  ""Maybe not that long,"" says Peeta. ""What was that you were saying just before the food arrived? Something about me. no competition. best thing that ever happened to you. ""  ""I don't remember that last part,"" I say, hoping it's too dim in here for the cameras to pick up my blush.  ""Oh, that's right. That's what I was thinking,"" he says. ""Scoot over, I'm freezing.""  I make room for him in the sleeping bag. We lean back against the cave wall, my head on his shoulder, his arms wrapped around me. I can feel Haymitch nudging me to keep up the act. ""So, since we were five, you never even noticed any other girls?"" I ask him.  ""No, I noticed just about every girl, but none of them made a lasting impression but you,"" he says.  ""I'm sure that would thrill your parents, you liking a girl from the Seam,"" I say.  ""Hardly. But I couldn't care less. Anyway, if we make it back, you won't be a girl from the Seam, you'll be a girl from the Victor's Village,"" he says.  That's right. If we win, we'll each get a house in the part of town reserved for Hunger Games' victors. Long ago, when the Games began, the Capitol had built a dozen fine houses in each district. Of course, in ours only one is occupied. Most of the others have never been lived in at all.  A disturbing thought hits me. ""But then, our only neighbor will be Haymitch!""  ""Ah, that'll be nice,"" says Peeta, tightening his arms around me. ""You and me and Haymitch. Very cozy. Picnics, birthdays, long winter nights around the fire retelling old Hunger Games' tales.""  ""I told you, he hates me!"" I say, but I can't help laughing at the image of Haymitch becoming my new pal.  ""Only sometimes. When he's sober, I've never heard him say one negative thing about you,"" says Peeta.  ""He's never sober!"" I protest.  ""That's right. Who am I thinking of? Oh, I know. It's Cinna who likes you. But that's mainly because you didn't try to run when he set you on fire,"" says Peeta. ""On the other hand, Haymitch. well, if I were you, I'd avoid Haymitch completely. He hates you.""  ""I thought you said I was his favorite,"" I say.  ""He hates me more,"" says Peeta. ""I don't think people in general are his sort of thing.""  I know the audience will enjoy our having fun at Haymitch's expense. He has been around so long, he's practically an old friend to some of them. And after his head-dive off the stage at the reaping, everybody knows him. By this time, they'll have dragged him out of the control room for interviews about us. No telling what sort of lies he's made up. He's at something of a disadvantage because most mentors have a partner, another victor to help them whereas Haymitch has to be ready to go into action at any moment. Kind of like me when I was alone in the arena. I wonder how he's holding up, with the drinking, the attention, and the stress of trying to keep us alive.  It's funny. Haymitch and I don't get along well in person, but maybe Peeta is right about us being alike because he seems able to communicate with me by the timing of his gifts. Like how I knew I must be close to water when he withheld it and how I knew the sleep syrup just wasn't something to ease Peeta's pain and how I know now that I have to play up the romance. He hasn't made much effort to connect with Peeta really. Perhaps he thinks a bowl of broth would just be a bowl of broth to Peeta, whereas I'll see the strings attached to it.  A thought hits me, and I'm amazed the question's taken so long to surface. Maybe it's because I've only recently begun to view Haymitch with a degree of curiosity. ""How do you think he did it?""  ""Who? Did what?"" Peeta asks.  ""Haymitch. How do you think he won the Games?"" I say.  Peeta considers this quite a while before he answers. Haymitch is sturdily built, but no physical wonder like Cato or Thresh. He's not particularly handsome. Not in the way that causes sponsors to rain gifts on you. And he's so surly, it's hard to imagine anyone teaming up with him. There's only one way Haymitch could have won, and Peeta says it just as I'm reaching this conclusion myself.  ""He outsmarted the others,"" says Peeta.  I nod, then let the conversation drop. But secretly I'm wondering if Haymitch sobered up long enough to help Peeta and me because he thought we just might have the wits to survive. Maybe he wasn't always a drunk. Maybe, in the beginning, he tried to help the tributes. But then it got unbearable. It must be hell to mentor two kids and then watch them die. Year after year after year. I realize that if I get out of here, that will become my job. To mentor the girl from District 12. The idea is so repellent, I thrust it from my mind.  About half an hour has passed before I decide I have to eat again. Peeta's too hungry himself to put up an argument. While I'm dishing up two more small servings of lamb stew and rice, we hear the anthem begin to play. Peeta presses his eyes against a crack in the rocks to watch the sky.  ""There won't be anything to see tonight,"" I say, far more interested in the stew than the sky. ""Nothing's happened or we would've heard a cannon.""  ""Katniss,"" Peeta says quietly.  ""What? Should we split another roll, too?"" I ask.  ""Katniss,"" he repeats, but I find myself wanting to ignore him.  ""I'm going to split one. But I'll save the cheese for tomorrow,"" I say. I see Peeta staring at me. ""What?""  ""Thresh is dead,"" says Peeta.  ""He can't be,"" I say.  ""They must have fired the cannon during the thunder and we missed it,"" says Peeta.  ""Are you sure? I mean, it's pouring buckets out there. I don't know how you can see anything,"" I say. I push him away from the rocks and squint out into the dark, rainy sky. For about ten seconds, I catch a distorted glimpse of Thresh's picture and then he's gone. Just like that.  I slump down against the rocks, momentarily forgetting about the task at hand. Thresh dead. I should be happy, right? One less tribute to face. And a powerful one, too. But I'm not happy. All I can think about is Thresh letting me go, letting me run because of Rue, who died with that spear in her stomach.  ""You all right?"" asks Peeta.  I give a noncommittal shrug and cup my elbows in my hands, hugging them close to my body. I have to bury the real pain because who's going to bet on a tribute who keeps sniveling over the deaths of her opponents. Rue was one thing. We were allies. She was so young. But no one will understand my sorrow at Thresh's murder. The word pulls me up short. Murder! Thankfully, I didn't say it aloud. That's not going to win me any points in the arena. What I do say is, ""It's just. if we didn't win. I wanted Thresh to. Because he let me go. And because of Rue.""  ""Yeah, I know,"" says Peeta. ""But this means we're one step closer to District Twelve."" He nudges a plate of foot into my hands. ""Eat. It's still warm.""  I take a bite of the stew to show I don't really care, but it's like glue in my mouth and takes a lot of effort to swallow. ""It also means Cato will be back hunting us.""  ""And he's got supplies again,"" says Peeta.  ""He'll be wounded, I bet,"" I say.  ""What makes you say that?"" Peeta asks.  ""Because Thresh would have never gone down without a fight. He's so strong, I mean, he was. And they were in his territory,"" I say.  ""Good,"" says Peeta. ""The more wounded Cato is the better. I wonder how Foxface is making out.""  ""Oh, she's fine,"" I say peevishly. I'm still angry she thought of hiding in the Cornucopia and I didn't. ""Probably be easier to catch Cato than her.""  ""Maybe they'll catch each other and we can just go home,"" says Peeta. ""But we better be extra careful about the watches. I dozed off a few times.""  ""Me, too,"" I admit. ""But not tonight.""  We finish our food in silence and then Peeta offers to take the first watch. I burrow down in the sleeping bag next to him, pulling my hood up over my face to hide it from the cameras. I just need a few moments of privacy where I can let any emotion cross my face without being seen. Under the hood, I silently say good-bye to Thresh and thank him for my life. I promise to remember him and, if I can, do something to help his family and Rue's, if I win. Then I escape into sleep, comforted by a full belly and the steady warmth of Peeta beside me.  When Peeta wakes me later, the first thing I register is the smell of goat cheese. He's holding out half a roll spread with the creamy white stuff and topped with apple slices. ""Don't be mad,"" he says. ""I had to eat again. Here's your half.""  ""Oh, good,"" I say, immediately taking a huge bite. The strong fatty cheese tastes just like the kind Prim makes, the apples are sweet and crunchy. ""Mm.""  ""We make a goat cheese and apple tart at the bakery,"" he says.  ""Bet that's expensive,"" I say.  ""Too expensive for my family to eat. Unless it's gone very stale. Of course, practically everything we eat is stale,"" says Peeta, pulling the sleeping bag up around him. In less than a minute, he's snoring.  Huh. I always assumed the shopkeepers live a soft life.  And it's true, Peeta has always had enough to eat. But there's something kind of depressing about living your life on stale bread, the hard, dry loaves that no one else wanted. One thing about us, since I bring our food home on a daily basis, most of it is so fresh you have to make sure it isn't going to make a run for it.  Somewhere during my shift, the rain stops not gradually but all at once. The downpour ends and there's only the residual drippings of water from branches, the rush of the now overflowing stream below us. A full, beautiful moon emerges, and even without the glasses I can see outside. I can't decide if the moon is real or merely a projection of the Gamemakers. I know it was full shortly before I left home. Gale and I watched it rise as we hunted into the late hours.  How long have I been gone? I'm guessing it's been about two weeks in the arena, and there was that week of preparation in the Capitol. Maybe the moon has completed its cycle. For some reason, I badly want it to be my moon, the same one I see from the woods around District 12. That would give me something to cling to in the surreal world of the arena where the authenticity of everything is to be doubted.  Four of us left.  For the first time, I allow myself to truly think about the possibility that I might make it home. To fame. To wealth. To my own house in the Victor's Village. My mother and Prim would live there with me. No more fear of hunger. A new kind of freedom. But then. what? What would my life be like on a daily basis? Most of it has been consumed with the acquisition of food. Take that away and I'm not really sure who I am, what my identity is. The idea scares me some. I think of Haymitch, with all his money. What did his life become? He lives alone, no wife or children, most of his waking hours drunk. I don't want to end up like that.  ""But you won't be alone,"" I whisper to myself. I have my mother and Prim. Well, for the time being. And then. I don't want to think about then, when Prim has grown up, my mother passed away. I know I'll never marry, never risk bringing a child into the world. Because if there's one thing being a victor doesn't guarantee, it's your children's safety. My kids' names would go right into the reaping balls with everyone else's. And I swear I'll never let that happen.  The sun eventually rises, its light slipping through the cracks and illuminating Peeta's face. Who will he transform into if we make it home? This perplexing, good-natured boy who can spin out lies so convincingly the whole of Panem believes him to be hopelessly in love with me, and I'll admit it, there are moments when he makes me believe it myself? At least, we'll be friends, I think. Nothing will change the fact that we've saved each other's lives in here. And beyond that, he will always be the boy with the bread. Good friends. Anything beyond that though. and I feel Gale's gray eyes watching me watching Peeta, all the way from District 12.  Discomfort causes me to move. I scoot over and shake Peeta's shoulder. His eyes open sleepily and when they focus on me, he pulls me down for a long kiss.  ""We're wasting hunting time,"" I say when I finally break away.  ""I wouldn't call it wasting,"" he says giving a big stretch as he sits up. ""So do we hunt on empty stomachs to give us an edge?""  ""Not us,"" I say. ""We stuff ourselves to give us staying power.""  ""Count me in,"" Peeta says. But I can see he's surprised when I divide the rest of the stew and rice and hand a heaping plate to him. ""All this?""  ""We'll earn it back today,"" I say, and we both plow into our plates. Even cold, it's one of the best things I've ever tasted. I abandon my fork and scrape up the last dabs of gravy with my finger. ""I can feel Effie Trinket shuddering at my manners.""  ""Hey, Effie, watch this!"" says Peeta. He tosses his fork over his shoulder and literally licks his plate clean with his tongue making loud, satisfied sounds. Then he blows a kiss out to her in general and calls, ""We miss you, Effie!""  I cover his mouth with my hand, but I'm laughing. ""Stop! Cato could be right outside our cave.""  He grabs my hand away. ""What do I care? I've got you to protect me now,"" says Peeta, pulling me to him.  ""Come on,"" I say in exasperation, extricating myself from his grasp but not before he gets in another kiss.  Once we're packed up and standing outside our cave, our mood shifts to serious. It's as though for the last few days, sheltered by the rocks and the rain and Cato's preoccupation with Thresh, we were given a respite, a holiday of sorts. Now, although the day is sunny and warm, we both sense we're really back in the Games. I hand Peeta my knife, since whatever weapons he once had are long gone, and he slips it into his belt. My last seven arrows  -  of the twelve I sacrificed three in the explosion, two at the feast  -  rattle a bit too loosely in the quiver. I can't afford to lose any more.  ""He'll be hunting us by now,"" says Peeta. ""Cato isn't one to wait for his prey to wander by.""  ""If he's wounded  - "" I begin.  ""It won't matter,"" Peeta breaks in. ""If he can move, he's coming.""  With all the rain, the stream has overrun its banks by several feet on either side. We stop there to replenish our water. I check the snares I set days ago and come up empty. Not surprising with the weather. Besides, I haven't seen many animals or signs of them in this area.  ""If we want food, we better head back up to my old hunting grounds,"" I say.  ""Your call. Just tell me what you need me to do,"" Peeta says.  ""Keep an eye out,"" I say. ""Stay on the rocks as much as possible, no sense in leaving him tracks to follow. And listen for both of us."" It's clear, at this point, that the explosion destroyed the hearing in my left ear for good.  I'd walk in the water to cover our tracks completely, but I'm not sure Peeta's leg could take the current. Although the drugs have erased the infection, he's still pretty weak. My forehead hurts along the knife cut, but after three days the bleeding has stopped. I wear a bandage around my head though, just in case physical exertion should bring it back.  As we head up alongside the stream, we pass the place where I found Peeta camouflaged in the weeds and mud. One good thing, between the downpour and the flooded banks, all signs of his hiding place have been wiped out. That means that, if need be, we can come back to our cave. Otherwise, I wouldn't risk it with Cato after us.  The boulders diminish to rocks that eventually turn to pebbles, and then, to my relief, we're back on pine needles and the gentle incline of the forest floor. For the first time, I realize we have a problem. Navigating the rocky terrain with a bad leg  -  well, you're naturally going to make some noise. But even on the smooth bed of needles, Peeta is loud. And I mean loud loud, as if he's stomping his feet or something. I turn and look at him.  ""What?"" he asks.  ""You've got to move more quietly,"" I say. ""Forget about Cato, you're chasing off every rabbit in a ten-mile radius.""  ""Really?"" he says. ""Sorry, I didn't know.""  So, we start up again and he's a tiny bit better, but even with only one working ear, he's making me jump.  ""Can you take your boots off?"" I suggest.  ""Here?"" he asks in disbelief, as if I'd asked him to walk barefoot on hot coals or something. I have to remind myself that he's still not used to the woods, that it's the scary, forbidden place beyond the fences of District 12. I think of Gale, with his velvet tread. It's eerie how little sound he makes, even when the leaves have fallen and it's a challenge to move at all without chasing off the game. I feel certain he's laughing back home.  ""Yes,"" I say patiently. ""I will, too. That way we'll both be quieter."" Like I was making any noise. So we both strip off our boots and socks and, while there's some improvement, I could swear he's making an effort to snap every branch we encounter.  Needless to say, although it takes several hours to reach my old camp with Rue, I've shot nothing. If the stream would settle down, fish might be an option, but the current is still too strong. As we stop to rest and drink water, I try to work out a solution. Ideally, I'd dump Peeta now with some simple root-gathering chore and go hunt, but then he'd be left with only a knife to defend himself against Cato's spears and superior strength. So what I'd really like is to try and conceal him somewhere safe, then go hunt, and come back and collect him. But I have a feeling his ego isn't going to go for that suggestion.  ""Katniss,"" he says. ""We need to split up. I know I'm chasing away the game.""  ""Only because your leg's hurt,"" I say generously, because really, you can tell that's only a small part of the problem.  ""I know,"" he says. ""So, why don't you go on? Show me some plants to gather and that way we'll both be useful.""  ""Not if Cato comes and kills you."" I tried to say it in a nice way, but it still sounds like I think he's a weakling.  Surprisingly, he just laughs. ""Look, I can handle Cato. I fought him before, didn't I?""  Yeah, and that turned out great. You ended up dying in a mud bank. That's what I want to say, but I can't. He did save my life by taking on Cato after all. I try another tactic. ""What if you climbed up in a tree and acted as a lookout while I hunted?"" I say, trying to make it sound like very important work.  ""What if you show me what's edible around here and go get us some meat?"" he says, mimicking my tone. ""Just don't go far, in case you need help.""  I sigh and show him some roots to dig. We do need food, no question. One apple, two rolls, and a blob of cheese the size of a plum won't last long. I'll just go a short distance and hope Cato is a long way off.  I teach him a bird whistle  -  not a melody like Rue's but a simple two-note whistle  -  which we can use to communicate that we're all right. Fortunately, he's good at this. Leaving him with the pack, I head off.  I feel like I'm eleven again, tethered not to the safety of the fence but to Peeta, allowing myself twenty, maybe thirty yards of hunting space. Away from him though, the woods come alive with animal sounds. Reassured by his periodic whistles, I allow myself to drift farther away, and soon have two rabbits and a fat squirrel to show for it. I decide it's enough. I can set snares and maybe get some fish. With Peeta's roots, this will be enough for now.  As I travel the short distance back, I realize we haven't exchanged signals in a while. When my whistle receives no response, I run. In no time, I find the pack, a neat pile of roots beside it. The sheet of plastic has been laid on the ground where the sun can reach the single layer of berries that covers it. But where is he?  ""Peeta!"" I call out in a panic. ""Peeta!"" I turn to the rustle of brush and almost send an arrow through him. Fortunately, I pull my bow at the last second and it sticks in an oak trunk to his left. He jumps back, flinging a handful of berries into the foliage.  My fear comes out as anger. ""What are you doing? You're supposed to be here, not running around in the woods!""  ""I found some berries down by the stream,"" he says, clearly confused by my outburst.  ""I whistled. Why didn't you whistle back?"" I snap at him.  ""I didn't hear. The water's too loud, I guess,"" he says. He crosses and puts his hands on my shoulders. That's when I feel that I'm trembling.  ""I thought Cato killed you!"" I almost shout.  ""No, I'm fine."" Peeta wraps his arms around me, but I don't respond. ""Katniss?""  I push away, trying to sort out my feelings. ""If two people agree on a signal, they stay in range. Because if one of them doesn't answer, they're in trouble, all right?""  ""All right!"" he says.  ""All right. Because that's what happened with Rue, and I watched her die!"" I say. I turn away from him, go to the pack and open a fresh bottle of water, although I still have some in mine. But I'm not ready to forgive him. I notice the food. The rolls and apples are untouched, but someone's definitely picked away part of the cheese. ""And you ate without me!"" I really don't care, I just want something else to be mad about.  ""What? No, I didn't,"" Peeta says.  ""Oh, and I suppose the apples ate the cheese,"" I say.  ""I don't know what ate the cheese,"" Peeta says slowly and distinctly, as if trying not to lose his temper, ""but it wasn't me. I've been down by the stream collecting berries. Would you care for some?""  I would actually, but I don't want to relent too soon. I do walk over and look at them. I've never seen this type before. No, I have. But not in the arena. These aren't Rue's berries, although they resemble them. Nor do they match any I learned about in training. I lean down and scoop up a few, rolling them between my fingers.  My father's voice comes back to me. ""Not these, Katniss. Never these. They're nightlock. You'll be dead before they reach your stomach.""  Just then, the cannon fires. I whip around, expecting Peeta to collapse to the ground, but he only raises his eyebrows. The hovercraft appears a hundred yards or so away. What's left of Foxface's emaciated body is lifted into the air. I can see the red glint of her hair in the sunlight.  I should have known the moment I saw the missing cheese.  Peeta has me by the arm, pushing me toward a tree. ""Climb. He'll be here in a second. We'll stand a better chance fighting him from above.""  I stop him, suddenly calm. ""No, Peeta, she's your kill, not Cato's.""  ""What? I haven't even seen her since the first day,"" he says. ""How could I have killed her?""  In answer, I hold out the berries."
Hunger Games Chapter 24,"It takes a while to explain the situation to Peeta. How Foxface stole the food from the supply pile before I blew it up, how she tried to take enough to stay alive but not enough that anyone would notice it, how she wouldn't question the safety of berries we were preparing to eat ourselves.  ""I wonder how she found us,"" says Peeta. ""My fault, I guess, if I'm as loud as you say.""  We were about as hard to follow as a herd of cattle, but I try to be kind. ""And she's very clever, Peeta. Well, she was. Until you outfoxed her.""  ""Not on purpose. Doesn't seem fair somehow. I mean, we would have both been dead, too, if she hadn't eaten the berries first."" He checks himself. ""No, of course, we wouldn't. You recognized them, didn't you?""  I give a nod. ""We call them nightlock.""  ""Even the name sounds deadly,"" he says. ""I'm sorry, Katniss. I really thought they were the same ones you'd gathered.""  ""Don't apologize. It just means we're one step closer to home, right?"" I ask.  ""I'll get rid of the rest,"" Peeta says. He gathers up the sheet of blue plastic, careful to trap the berries inside, and goes to toss them into the woods.  ""Wait!"" I cry. I find the leather pouch that belonged to the boy from District 1 and fill it with a few handfuls of berries from the plastic. ""If they fooled Foxface, maybe they can fool Cato as well. If he's chasing us or something, we can act like we accidentally drop the pouch and if he eats them  - ""  ""Then hello District Twelve,"" says Peeta.  ""That's it,"" I say, securing the pouch to my belt.  ""He'll know where we are now,"" says Peeta. ""If he was anywhere nearby and saw that hovercraft, he'll know we killed her and come after us.""  Peeta's right. This could be just the opportunity Cato's been waiting for. But even if we run now, there's the meat to cook and our fire will be another sign of our whereabouts. ""Let's make a fire. Right now."" I begin to gather branches and brush.  ""Are you ready to face him?"" Peeta asks.  ""I'm ready to eat. Better to cook our food while we have the chance. If he knows we're here, he knows. But he also knows there's two of us and probably assumes we were hunting Foxface. That means you're recovered. And the fire means we're not hiding, we're inviting him here. Would you show up?"" I ask.  ""Maybe not,"" he says.  Peeta's a whiz with fires, coaxing a blaze out of the damp wood. In no time, I have the rabbits and squirrel roasting, the roots, wrapped in leaves, baking in the coals. We take turns gathering greens and keeping a careful watch for Cato, but as I anticipated, he doesn't make an appearance.  When the food's cooked, I pack most of it up, leaving us each a rabbit's leg to eat as we walk.  I want to move higher into the woods, climb a good tree, and make camp for the night, but Peeta resists. ""I can't climb like you, Katniss, especially with my leg, and I don't think I could ever fall asleep fifty feet above the ground.""  ""It's not safe to stay in the open, Peeta,"" I say.  ""Can't we go back to the cave?"" he asks. ""It's near water and easy to defend.""  I sigh. Several more hours of walking  -  or should I say crashing  -  through the woods to reach an area we'll just have to leave in the morning to hunt. But Peeta doesn't ask for much. He's followed my instructions all day and I'm sure if things were reversed, he wouldn't make me spend the night in a tree. It dawns on me that I haven't been very nice to Peeta today. Nagging him about how loud he was, screaming at him over disappearing. The playful romance we had sustained in the cave has disappeared out in the open, under the hot sun, with the threat of Cato looming over us. Haymitch has probably just about had it with me. And as for the audience.  I reach up and give him a kiss. ""Sure. Let's go back to the cave.""  He looks pleased and relieved. ""Well, that was easy.""  I work my arrow out of the oak, careful not to damage the shaft. These arrows are food, safety, and life itself now.  We toss a bunch more wood on the fire. It should be sending off smoke for a few more hours, although I doubt Cato assumes anything at this point. When we reach the stream, I see the water has dropped considerably and moves at its old leisurely pace, so I suggest we walk back in it. Peeta's happy to oblige and since he's a lot quieter in water than on land, it's a doubly good idea. It's a long walk back to the cave though, even going downward, even with the rabbit to give us a boost. We're both exhausted by our hike today and still way too underfed. I keep my bow loaded, both for Cato and any fish I might see, but the stream seems strangely empty of creatures.  By the time we reach our destination, our feet are dragging and the sun sits low on the horizon. We fill up our water bottles and climb the little slope to our den. It's not much, but out here in the wilderness, it's the closest thing we have to a home. It will be warmer than a tree, too, because it provides some shelter from the wind that has begun to blow steadily in from the west. I set a good dinner out, but halfway through Peeta begins to nod off. After days of inactivity, the hunt has taken its toll. I order him into the sleeping bag and set aside the rest of his food for when he wakes. He drops off immediately. I pull the sleeping bag up to his chin and kiss his forehead, not for the audience, but for me. Because I'm so grateful that he's still here, not dead by the stream as I'd thought. So glad that I don't have to face Cato alone.  Brutal, bloody Cato who can snap a neck with a twist of his arm, who had the power to overcome Thresh, who has had it out for me since the beginning. He probably has had a special hatred for me ever since I outscored him in training. A boy like Peeta would simply shrug that off. But I have a feeling it drove Cato to distraction. Which is not that hard. I think of his ridiculous reaction to finding the supplies blown up. The others were upset, of course, but he was completely unhinged. I wonder now if Cato might not be entirely sane.  The sky lights up with the seal, and I watch Foxface shine in the sky and then disappear from the world forever. He hasn't said it, but I don't think Peeta felt good about killing her, even if it was essential. I can't pretend I'll miss her, but I have to admire her. My guess is if they had given us some sort of test, she would have been the smartest of all the tributes. If, in fact, we had been setting a trap for her, I bet she'd have sensed it and avoided the berries. It was Peeta's own ignorance that brought her down. I've spent so much time making sure I don't underestimate my opponents that I've forgotten it's just as dangerous to overestimate them as well.  That brings me back to Cato. But while I think I had a sense of Foxface, who she was and how she operated, he's a little more slippery. Powerful, well trained, but smart? I don't know. Not like she was. And utterly lacking in the control Foxface demonstrated. I believe Cato could easily lose his judgment in a fit of temper. Not that I can feel superior on that point. I think of the moment I sent the arrow flying into the apple in the pig's mouth when I was so enraged. Maybe I do understand Cato better than I think.  Despite the fatigue in my body, my mind's alert, so I let Peeta sleep long past our usual switch. In fact, a soft gray day has begun when I shake his shoulder. He looks out, almost in alarm. ""I slept the whole night. That's not fair, Katniss, you should have woken me.""  I stretch and burrow down into the bag. ""I'll sleep now. Wake me if anything interesting happens.""  Apparently nothing does, because when I open my eyes, bright hot afternoon light gleams through the rocks. ""Any sign of our friend?"" I ask.  Peeta shakes his head. ""No, he's keeping a disturbingly low profile.""  ""How long do you think we'll have before the Gamemakers drive us together?"" I ask.  ""Well, Foxface died almost a day ago, so there's been plenty of time for the audience to place bets and get bored. I guess it could happen at any moment,"" says Peeta.  ""Yeah, I have a feeling today's the day,"" I say. I sit up and look out at the peaceful terrain. ""I wonder how they'll do it.""  Peeta remains silent. There's not really any good answer.  ""Well, until they do, no sense in wasting a hunting day. But we should probably eat as much as we can hold just in case we run into trouble,"" I say.  Peeta packs up our gear while I lay out a big meal. The rest of the rabbits, roots, greens, the rolls spread with the last bit of cheese. The only thing I leave in reserve is the squirrel and the apple.  By the time we're done, all that's left is a pile of rabbit bones. My hands are greasy, which only adds to my growing feeling of grubbiness. Maybe we don't bathe daily in the Seam, but we keep cleaner than I have of late. Except for my feet, which have walked in the stream, I'm covered in a layer of grime.  Leaving the cave has a sense of finality about it. I don't think there will be another night in the arena somehow. One way or the other, dead or alive, I have the feeling I'll escape it today. I give the rocks a pat good-bye and we head down to the stream to wash up. I can feel my skin, itching for the cool water. I may do my hair and braid it back wet. I'm wondering if we might even be able to give our clothes a quick scrub when we reach the stream. Or what used to be the stream. Now there's only a bone-dry bed. I put my hand down to feel it.  ""Not even a little damp. They must have drained it while we slept,"" I say. A fear of the cracked tongue, aching body and fuzzy mind brought on by my previous dehydration creeps into my consciousness. Our bottles and skin are fairly full, but with two drinking and this hot sun it won't take long to deplete them.  ""The lake,"" says Peeta. ""That's where they want us to go.""  ""Maybe the ponds still have some,"" I say hopefully.  ""We can check,"" he says, but he's just humoring me. I'm humoring myself because I know what I'll find when we return to the pond where I soaked my leg. A dusty, gaping mouth of a hole. But we make the trip anyway just to confirm what we already know.  ""You're right. They're driving us to the lake,"" I say. Where there's no cover. Where they're guaranteed a bloody fight to the death with nothing to block their view. ""Do you want to go straightaway or wait until the water's tapped out?""  ""Let's go now, while we've had food and rest. Let's just go end this thing,"" he says.  I nod. It's funny. I feel almost as if it's the first day of the Games again. That I'm in the same position. Twenty-one tributes are dead, but I still have yet to kill Cato. And really, wasn't he always the one to kill? Now it seems the other tributes were just minor obstacles, distractions, keeping us from the real battle of the Games. Cato and me.  But no, there's the boy waiting beside me. I feel his arms wrap around me.  ""Two against one. Should be a piece of cake,"" he says.  ""Next time we eat, it will be in the Capitol,"" I answer.  ""You bet it will,"" he says.  We stand there a while, locked in an embrace, feeling each other, the sunlight, the rustle of the leaves at our feet. Then without a word, we break apart and head for the lake.  I don't care now that Peeta's footfalls send rodents scurrying, make birds take wing. We have to fight Cato and I'd just as soon do it here as on the plain. But I doubt I'll have that choice. If the Gamemakers want us in the open, then in the open we will be.  We stop to rest for a few moments under the tree where the Careers trapped me. The husk of the tracker jacker nest, beaten to a pulp by the heavy rains and dried in the burning sun, confirms the location. I touch it with the tip of my boot, and it dissolves into dust that is quickly carried off by the breeze. I can't help looking up in the tree where Rue secretly perched, waiting to save my life. Tracker jackers. Glimmer's bloated body. The terrifying hallucinations.  ""Let's move on,"" I say, wanting to escape the darkness that surrounds this place. Peeta doesn't object.  Given our late start to the day, when we reach the plain it's already early evening. There's no sign of Cato. No sign of anything except the gold Cornucopia glowing in the slanting sun rays. Just in case Cato decided to pull a Foxface on us, we circle the Cornucopia to make sure it's empty. Then obediently, as if following instructions, we cross to the lake and fill our water containers.  I frown at the shrinking sun. ""We don't want to fight him after dark. There's only the one pair of glasses.""  Peeta carefully squeezes drops of iodine into the water. ""Maybe that's what he's waiting for. What do you want to do? Go back to the cave?""  ""Either that or find a tree. But let's give him another half an hour or so. Then we'll take cover,"" I answer.  We sit by the lake, in full sight. There's no point in hiding now. In the trees at the edge of the plain, I can see the mockingjays flitting about. Bouncing melodies back and forth between them like brightly colored balls. I open my mouth and sing out Rue's four-note run. I can feel them pause curiously at the sound of my voice, listening for more. I repeat the notes in the silence. First one mockingjay trills the tune back, then another. Then the whole world comes alive with the sound.  ""Just like your father,"" says Peeta.  My fingers find the pin on my shirt. ""That's Rue's song,"" I say. ""I think they remember it.""  The music swells and I recognize the brilliance of it. As the notes overlap, they compliment one another, forming a lovely, unearthly harmony. It was this sound then, thanks to Rue, that sent the orchard workers of District 11 home each night. Does someone start it at quitting time, I wonder, now that she is dead?  For a while, I just close my eyes and listen, mesmerized by the beauty of the song. Then something begins to disrupt the music. Runs cut off in jagged, imperfect lines. Dissonant notes intersperse with the melody. The mockingjays' voices rise up in a shrieking cry of alarm.  We're on our feet, Peeta wielding his knife, me poised to shoot, when Cato smashes through the trees and bears down on us. He has no spear. In fact, his hands are empty, yet he runs straight for us. My first arrow hits his chest and inexplicably falls aside.  ""He's got some kind of body armor!"" I shout to Peeta.  Just in time, too, because Cato is upon us. I brace myself, but he rockets right between us with no attempt to check his speed. I can tell from his panting, the sweat pouring off his purplish face, that he's been running hard a long time. Not toward us. From something. But what?  My eyes scan the woods just in time to see the first creature leap onto the plain. As I'm turning away, I see another half dozen join it. Then I am stumbling blindly after Cato with no thought of anything but to save myself."
Hunger Games Chapter 25,"Mutations. No question about it. I've never seen these mutts, but they're no natural-born animals. They resemble huge wolves, but what wolf lands and then balances easily on its hind legs? What wolf waves the rest of the pack forward with its front paw as though it had a wrist? These things I can see at a distance. Up close, I'm sure their more menacing attributes will be revealed.  Cato has made a beeline for the Cornucopia, and without question I follow him. If he thinks it's the safest place, who am I to argue? Besides, even if I could make it to the trees, it would be impossible for Peeta to outrun them on that leg  -  Peeta! My hands have just landed on the metal at the pointed tail of the Cornucopia when I remember I'm part of a team. He's about fifteen yards behind me, hobbling as fast as he can, but the mutts are closing in on him fast. I send an arrow into the pack and one goes down, but there are plenty to take its place.  Peeta's waving me up the horn, ""Go, Katniss! Go!""  He's right. I can't protect either of us on the ground. I start climbing, scaling the Cornucopia on my hands and feet. The pure gold surface has been designed to resemble the woven horn that we fill at harvest, so there are little ridges and seams to get a decent hold on. But after a day in the arena sun, the metal feels hot enough to blister my hands.  Cato lies on his side at the very top of the horn, twenty feet above the ground, gasping to catch his breath as he gags over the edge. Now's my chance to finish him off. I stop midway up the horn and load another arrow, but just as I'm about to let it fly, I hear Peeta cry out. I twist around and see he's just reached the tail, and the mutts are right on his heels.  ""Climb!"" I yell. Peeta starts up hampered by not only the leg but the knife in his hand. I shoot my arrow down the throat of the first mutt that places its paws on the metal. As it dies the creature lashes out, inadvertently opening gashes on a few of its companions. That's when I get a look at the claws. Four inches and clearly razor-sharp.  Peeta reaches my feet and I grab his arm and pull him along. Then I remember Cato waiting at the top and whip around, but he's doubled over with cramps and apparently more preoccupied with the mutts than us. He coughs out something unintelligible. The snuffling, growling sound coming from the mutts isn't helping.  ""What?"" I shout at him.  ""He said, 'Can they climb it?'"" answers Peeta, drawing my focus back to the base of the horn.  The mutts are beginning to assemble. As they join together, they raise up again to stand easily on their back legs giving them an eerily human quality. Each has a thick coat, some with fur that is straight and sleek, others curly, and the colors vary from jet black to what I can only describe as blond. There's something else about them, something that makes the hair rise up on the back of my neck, but I can't put my finger on it.  They put their snouts on the horn, sniffing and tasting the metal, scraping paws over the surface and then making high-pitched yipping sounds to one another. This must be how they communicate because the pack backs up as if to make room. Then one of them, a good-size mutt with silky waves of blond fur takes a running start and leaps onto the horn. Its back legs must be incredibly powerful because it lands a mere ten feet below us, its pink lips pulled back in a snarl. For a moment it hangs there, and in that moment I realize what else unsettled me about the mutts. The green eyes glowering at me are unlike any dog or wolf, any canine I've ever seen. They are unmistakably human. And that revelation has barely registered when I notice the collar with the number 1 inlaid with jewels and the whole horrible thing hits me. The blonde hair, the green eyes, the number. it's Glimmer.  A shriek escapes my lips and I'm having trouble holding the arrow in place. I have been waiting to fire, only too aware of my dwindling supply of arrows. Waiting to see if the creatures can, in fact, climb. But now, even though the mutt has begun to slide backward, unable to find any purchase on the metal, even though I can hear the slow screeching of the claws like nails on a blackboard, I fire into its throat. Its body twitches and flops onto the ground with a thud.  ""Katniss?"" I can feel Peeta's grip on my arm.  ""It's her!"" I get out.  ""Who?"" asks Peeta.  My head snaps from side to side as I examine the pack, taking in the various sizes and colors. The small one with the red coat and amber eyes. Foxface! And there, the ashen hair and hazel eyes of the boy from District 9 who died as we struggled for the backpack! And worst of all, the smallest mutt, with dark glossy fur, huge brown eyes and a collar that reads 11 in woven straw. Teeth bared in hatred. Rue.  ""What is it, Katniss?"" Peeta shakes my shoulder.  ""It's them. It's all of them. The others. Rue and Foxface and. all of the other tributes,"" I choke out.  I hear Peeta's gasp of recognition. ""What did they do to them? You don't think. those could be their real eyes?""  Their eyes are the least of my worries. What about their brains? Have they been given any of the real tributes memories? Have they been programmed to hate our faces particularly because we have survived and they were so callously murdered? And the ones we actually killed. do they believe they're avenging their own deaths?  Before I can get this out, the mutts begin a new assault on the horn. They've split into two groups at the sides of the horn and are using those powerful hindquarters to launch themselves at us. A pair of teeth ring together just inches from my hand and then I hear Peeta cry out, feel the yank on his body, the heavy weight of boy and mutt pulling me over the side. If not for the grip on my arm, he'd be on the ground, but as it is, it takes all my strength to keep us both on the curved back of the horn. And more tributes are coming.  ""Kill it, Peeta! Kill it!"" I'm shouting, and although I can't quite see what's happening, I know he must have stabbed the thing because the pull lessens. I'm able to haul him back onto the horn where we drag ourselves toward the top where the lesser of two evils awaits.  Cato has still not regained his feet, but his breathing is slowing and I know soon he'll be recovered enough to come for us, to hurl us over the side to our deaths. I arm my bow, but the arrow ends up taking out a mutt that can only be Thresh. Who else could jump so high? I feel a moment's relief because we must finally be up above the mutt line and I'm just turning back to face Cato when Peeta's jerked from my side. I'm sure the pack has got him until his blood splatters my face.  Cato stands before me, almost at the lip of the horn, holding Peeta in some kind of headlock, cutting off his air. Peeta's clawing at Cato's arm, but weakly, as if confused over whether it's more important to breathe or try and stem the gush of blood from the gaping hole a mutt left in his calf.  I aim one of my last two arrows at Cato's head, knowing it'll have no effect on his trunk or limbs, which I can now see are clothed in a skintight, flesh-colored mesh. Some high-grade body armor from the Capitol. Was that what was in his pack at the feast? Body armor to defend against my arrows? Well, they neglected to send a face guard.  Cato just laughs. ""Shoot me and he goes down with me.""  He's right. If I take him out and he falls to the mutts, Peeta is sure to die with him. We've reached a stalemate. I can't shoot Cato without killing Peeta, too. He can't kill Peeta without guaranteeing an arrow in his brain. We stand like statues, both of us seeking an out.  My muscles are strained so tightly, they feel they might snap at any moment. My teeth clenched to the breaking point. The mutts go silent and the only thing I can hear is the blood pounding in my good ear.  Peeta's lips are turning blue. If I don't do something quickly, he'll die of asphyxiation and then I'll have lost him and Cato will probably use his body as a weapon against me. In fact, I'm sure this is Cato's plan because while he's stopped laughing, his lips are set in a triumphant smile.  As if in a last-ditch effort, Peeta raises his fingers, dripping with blood from his leg, up to Cato's arm. Instead of trying to wrestle his way free, his forefinger veers off and makes a deliberate X on the back of Cato's hand. Cato realizes what it means exactly one second after I do. I can tell by the way the smile drops from his lips. But it's one second too late because, by that time, my arrow is piercing his hand. He cries out and reflexively releases Peeta who slams back against him. For a horrible moment, I think they're both going over. I dive forward just catching hold of Peeta as Cato loses his footing on the blood-slick horn and pluminets to the ground.  We hear him hit, the air leaving his body on impact, and then the mutts attack him. Peeta and I hold on to each other, waiting for the cannon, waiting for the competition to finish, waiting to be released. But it doesn't happen. Not yet. Because this is the climax of the Hunger Games, and the audience expects a show.  I don't watch, but I can hear the snarls, the growls, the howls of pain from both human and beast as Cato takes on the mutt pack. I can't understand how he can be surviving until I remember the body armor protecting him from ankle to neck and I realize what a long night this could be. Cato must have a knife or sword or something, too, something he had hidden in his clothes, because on occasion there's the death scream of a mutt or the sound of metal on metal as the blade collides with the golden horn. The combat moves around the side of the Cornucopia, and I know Cato must be attempting the one maneuver that could save his life  -  to make his way back around to the tail of the horn and rejoin us. But in the end, despite his remarkable strength and skill, he is simply overpowered.  I don't know how long it has been, maybe an hour or so, when Cato hits the ground and we hear the mutts dragging him, dragging him back into the Cornucopia. Now they'll finish him off, I think. But there's still no cannon.  Night falls and the anthem plays and there's no picture of Cato in the sky, only the faint moans coming through the metal beneath us. The icy air blowing across the plain reminds me that the Games are not over and may not be for who knows how long, and there is still no guarantee of victory.  I turn my attention to Peeta and discover his leg is bleeding as badly as ever. All our supplies, our packs, remain down by the lake where we abandoned them when we fled from the mutts. I have no bandage, nothing to staunch the flow of blood from his calf. Although I'm shaking in the biting wind, I rip off my jacket, remove my shirt, and zip back into the jacket as swiftly as possible. That brief exposure sets my teeth chattering beyond control.  Peeta's face is gray in the pale moonlight. I make him lie down before I probe his wound. Warm, slippery blood runs over my fingers. A bandage will not be enough. I've seen my mother tie a tourniquet a handful of times and try to replicate it. I cut free a sleeve from my shirt, wrap it twice around his leg just under his knee, and tie a half knot. I don't have a stick, so I take my remaining arrow and insert it in the knot, twisting it as tightly as I dare. It's risky business  -  Peeta may end up losing his leg  -  but when I weigh this against him losing his life, what alternative do I have? I bandage the wound in the rest of my shirt and lay down with him.  ""Don't go to sleep,"" I tell him. I'm not sure if this is exactly medical protocol, but I'm terrified that if he drifts off he'll never wake again.  ""Are you cold?"" he asks. He unzips his jacket and I press against him as he fastens it around me. It's a bit warmer, sharing our body heat inside my double layer of jackets, but the night is young. The temperature will continue to drop.  Even now I can feel the Cornucopia, which burned so when I first climbed it, slowly turning to ice.  ""Cato may win this thing yet,"" I whisper to Peeta.  ""Don't you believe it,"" he says, pulling up my hood, but he's shaking harder than I am.  The next hours are the worst in my life, which if you think about it, is saying something. The cold would be torture enough, but the real nightmare is listening to Cato, moaning, begging, and finally just whimpering as the mutts work away at him. After a very short time, I don't care who he is or what he's done, all I want is for his suffering to end.  ""Why don't they just kill him?"" I ask Peeta.  ""You know why,"" he says, and pulls me closer to him.  And I do. No viewer could turn away from the show now. From the Gamemakers' point of view, this is the final word in entertainment.  It goes on and on and on and eventually completely consumes my mind, blocking out memories and hopes of tomorrow, erasing everything but the present, which I begin to believe will never change. There will never be anything but cold and fear and the agonized sounds of the boy dying in the horn.  Peeta begins to doze off now, and each time he does, I find myself yelling his name louder and louder because if he goes and dies on me now, I know I'll go completely insane. He's fighting it, probably more for me than for him, and it's hard because unconsciousness would be its own form of escape. But the adrenaline pumping through my body would never allow me to follow him, so I can't let him go. I just can't.  The only indication of the passage of time lies in the heavens, the subtle shift of the moon. So Peeta begins pointing it out to me, insisting I acknowledge its progress and sometimes, for just a moment I feel a flicker of hope before the agony of the night engulfs me again.  Finally, I hear him whisper that the sun is rising. I open my eyes and find the stars fading in the pale light of dawn. I can see, too, how bloodless Peeta's face has become. How little time he has left. And I know I have to get him back to the Capitol.  Still, no cannon has fired. I press my good ear against the horn and can just make out Cato's voice.  ""I think he's closer now. Katniss, can you shoot him?"" Peeta asks.  If he's near the mouth, I may be able to take him out. It would be an act of mercy at this point.  ""My last arrow's in your tourniquet,"" I say.  ""Make it count,"" says Peeta, unzipping his jacket, letting me loose.  So I free the arrow, tying the tourniquet back as tightly as my frozen fingers can manage. I rub my hands together, trying to regain circulation. When I crawl to the lip of the horn and hang over the edge, I feel Peeta's hands grip me for support.  It takes a few moments to find Cato in the dim light, in the blood. Then the raw hunk of meat that used to be my enemy makes a sound, and I know where his mouth is. And I think the word he's trying to say is please.  Pity, not vengeance, sends my arrow flying into his skull. Peeta pulls me back up, bow in hand, quiver empty.  ""Did you get him?"" he whispers.  The cannon fires in answer.  ""Then we won, Katniss,"" he says hollowly.  ""Hurray for us,"" I get out, but there's no joy of victory in my voice.  A hole opens in the plain and as if on cue, the remaining mutts bound into it, disappearing as the earth closes above them.  We wait, for the hovercraft to take Cato's remains, for the trumpets of victory that should follow, but nothing happens.  ""Hey!"" I shout into air. ""What's going on?"" The only response is the chatter of waking birds.  ""Maybe it's the body. Maybe we have to move away from it,"" says Peeta.  I try to remember. Do you have to distance yourself from the dead tribute on the final kill? My brain is too muddled to be sure, but what else could be the reason for the delay?  ""Okay. Think you could make it to the lake?"" I ask.  ""Think I better try,"" says Peeta. We inch down to the tail of the horn and fall to the ground. If the stiffness in my limbs is this bad, how can Peeta even move? I rise first, swinging and bending my arms and legs until I think I can help him up. Somehow, we make it back to the lake. I scoop up a handful of the cold water for Peeta and bring a second to my lips.  A mockingjay gives the long, low whistle, and tears of relief fill my eyes as the hovercraft appears and takes Cato's body away. Now they will take us. Now we can go home.  But again there's no response.  ""What are they waiting for?"" says Peeta weakly. Between the loss of the tourniquet and the effort it took to get to the lake, his wound has opened up again.  ""I don't know,"" I say. Whatever the holdup is, I can't watch him lose any more blood. I get up to find a stick but almost immediately come across the arrow that bounced off Cato's body armor. It will do as well as the other arrow. As I stoop to pick it up, Claudius Templesmith's voice booms into the arena.  ""Greetings to the final contestants of the Seventy-fourth Hunger Games. The earlier revision has been revoked. Closer examination of the rule book has disclosed that only one winner may be allowed,"" he says. ""Good luck and may the odds be ever in your favor.""  There's a small burst of static and then nothing more. I stare at Peeta in disbelief as the truth sinks in. They never intended to let us both live. This has all been devised by the Gamemakers to guarantee the most dramatic showdown in history. And like a fool, I bought into it.  ""If you think about it, it's not that surprising,"" he says softly. I watch as he painfully makes it to his feet. Then he's moving toward me, as if in slow motion, his hand is pulling the knife from his belt  -  Before I am even aware of my actions, my bow is loaded with the arrow pointed straight at his heart. Peeta raises his eyebrows and I see the knife has already left his hand on its way to the lake where it splashes in the water. I drop my weapons and take a step back, my face burning in what can only be shame.  ""No,"" he says. ""Do it."" Peeta limps toward me and thrusts the weapons back in my hands.  ""I can't, I say. ""I won't.""  ""Do it. Before they send those mutts back or something. I don't want to die like Cato,"" he says.  ""Then you shoot me,"" I say furiously, shoving the weapons back at him. ""You shoot me and go home and live with it!"" And as I say it, I know death right here, right now would be the easier of the two.  ""You know I can't,"" Peeta says, discarding the weapons. ""Fine, I'll go first anyway."" He leans down and rips the bandage off his leg, eliminating the final barrier between his blood and the earth.  ""No, you can't kill yourself,"" I say. I'm on my knees, desperately plastering the bandage back onto his wound.  ""Katniss,"" he says. ""It's what I want.""  ""You're not leaving me here alone,"" I say. Because if he dies, I'll never go home, not really. I'll spend the rest of my life in this arena trying to think my way out.  ""Listen,"" he says pulling me to my feet. ""We both know they have to have a victor. It can only be one of us. Please, take it. For me."" And he goes on about how he loves me, what life would be without me but I've stopped listening because his previous words are trapped in my head, thrashing desperately around.  We both know they have to have a victor.  Yes, they have to have a victor. Without a victor, the whole thing would blow up in the Gamemakers' faces. They'd have failed the Capitol. Might possibly even be executed, slowly and painfully while the cameras broadcast it to every screen in the country.  If Peeta and I were both to die, or they thought we were.  My fingers fumble with the pouch on my belt, freeing it. Peeta sees it and his hand clamps on my wrist. ""No, I won't let you.""  ""Trust me,"" I whisper. He holds my gaze for a long moment then lets me go. I loosen the top of the pouch and pour a few spoonfuls of berries into his palm. Then I fill my own. ""On the count of three?""  Peeta leans down and kisses me once, very gently. ""The count of three,"" he says.  We stand, our backs pressed together, our empty hands locked tight.  ""Hold them out. I want everyone to see,"" he says.  I spread out my fingers, and the dark berries glisten in the sun. I give Peeta's hand one last squeeze as a signal, as a good-bye, and we begin counting. ""One."" Maybe I'm wrong. ""Two."" Maybe they don't care if we both die. ""Three!"" It's too late to change my mind. I lift my hand to my mouth, taking one last look at the world. The berries have just passed my lips when the trumpets begin to blare.  The frantic voice of Claudius Templesmith shouts above them. ""Stop! Stop! Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to present the victors of the Seventy-fourth Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark! I give you  -  the tributes of District Twelve!"""
Hunger Games Chapter 26,"I spew the berries from my mouth, wiping my tongue with the end of my shirt to make sure no juice remains. Peeta pulls me to the lake where we both flush our mouths with water and then collapse into each other's arms.  ""You didn't swallow any?"" I ask him.  He shakes his head. ""You?""  ""Guess I'd be dead by now if I did,"" I say. I can see his lips moving in reply, but I can't hear him over the roar of the crowd in the Capitol that they're playing live over the speakers.  The hovercraft materializes overhead and two ladders drop, only there's no way I'm letting go of Peeta. I keep one arm around him as I help him up, and we each place a foot on the first rung of the ladder. The electric current freezes us in place, and this time I'm glad because I'm not really sure Peeta can hang on for the whole ride. And since my eyes were looking down, I can see that while our muscles are immobile, nothing is preventing the blood from draining out of Peeta's leg. Sure enough, the minute the door closes behind us and the current stops, he slumps to the floor unconscious.  My fingers are still gripping the back of his jacket so tightly that when they take him away it tears leaving me with a fistful of black fabric. Doctors in sterile white, masked and gloved, already prepped to operate, go into action. Peeta's so pale and still on a silver table, tubes and wires springing out of him every which way, and for a moment I forget we're out of the Games and I see the doctors as just one more threat, one more pack of mutts designed to kill him. Petrified, I lunge for him, but I'm caught and thrust back into another room, and a glass door seals between us. I pound on the glass, screaming my head off. Everyone ignores me except for some Capitol attendant who appears behind me and offers me a beverage.  I slump down on the floor, my face against the door, staring uncomprehendingly at the crystal glass in my hand. Icy cold, filled with orange juice, a straw with a frilly white collar. How wrong it looks in my bloody, filthy hand with its dirt-caked nails and scars. My mouth waters at the smell, but I place it carefully on the floor, not trusting anything so clean and pretty.  Through the glass, I see the doctors working feverishly on Peeta, their brows creased in concentration. I see the flow of liquids, pumping through the tubes, watch a wall of dials and lights that mean nothing to me. I'm not sure, but I think his heart stops twice.  It's like being home again, when they bring in the hopelessly mangled person from the mine explosion, or the woman in her third day of labor, or the famished child struggling against pneumonia and my mother and Prim, they wear that same look on their faces. Now is the time to run away to the woods, to hide in the trees until the patient is long gone and in another part of the Seam the hammers make the coffin. But I'm held here both by the hovercraft walls and the same force that holds the loved ones of the dying. How often I've seen them, ringed around our kitchen table and I thought, Why don't they leave? Why do they stay to watch?  And now I know. It's because you have no choice.  I startle when I catch someone staring at me from only a few inches away and then realize it's my own face reflecting back in the glass. Wild eyes, hollow cheeks, my hair in a tangled mat. Rabid. Feral. Mad. No wonder everyone is keeping a safe distance from me.  The next thing I know we've landed back on the roof of the Training Center and they're taking Peeta but leaving me behind the door. I start hurling myself against the glass, shrieking and I think I just catch a glimpse of pink hair  -  it must be Effie, it has to be Effie coming to my rescue  -  when the needle jabs me from behind.  When I wake, I'm afraid to move at first. The entire ceiling glows with a soft yellow light allowing me to see that I'm in a room containing just my bed. No doors, no windows are visible. The air smells of something sharp and antiseptic. My right arm has several tubes that extend into the wall behind me. I'm naked, but the bedclothes arc soothing against my skin. I tentatively lift my left hand above the cover. Not only has it been scrubbed clean, the nails are filed in perfect ovals, the scars from the burns are less prominent. I touch my cheek, my lips, the puckered scar above my eyebrow, and am just running my fingers through my silken hair when I freeze. Apprehensively I ruffle the hair by my left ear. No, it wasn't an illusion. I can hear again.  I try and sit up, but some sort of wide restraining band around my waist keeps me from rising more than a few inches. The physical confinement makes me panic and I'm trying to pull myself up and wriggle my hips through the band when a portion of the wall slides open and in steps the redheaded Avox girl carrying a tray. The sight of her calms me and I stop trying to escape. I want to ask her a million questions, but I'm afraid any familiarity would cause her harm. Obviously I am being closely monitored. She sets the tray across my thighs and presses something that raises me to a sitting position. While she adjusts my pillows, I risk one question. I say it out loud, as clearly as my rusty voice will allow, so nothing will seem secretive. ""Did Peeta make it?"" She gives me a nod, and as she slips a spoon into my hand, I feel the pressure of friendship.  I guess she did not wish me dead after all. And Peeta has made it. Of course, he did. With all their expensive equipment here. Still, I hadn't been sure until now.  As the Avox leaves, the door closes noiselessly after her and I turn hungrily to the tray. A bowl of clear broth, a small serving of applesauce, and a glass of water. This is it? I think grouchily. Shouldn't my homecoming dinner be a little more spectacular? But I find it's an effort to finish the spare meal before me. My stomach seems to have shrunk to the size of a chestnut, and I have to wonder how long I've been out because I had no trouble eating a fairly sizable breakfast that last morning in the arena. There's usually a lag of a few days between the end of the competition and the presentation of the victor so that they can put the starving, wounded, mess of a person back together again. Somewhere, Cinna and Portia will be creating our wardrobes for the public appearances. Haymitch and Effie will be arranging the banquet for our sponsors, reviewing the questions for our final interviews. Back home, District 12 is probably in chaos as they try and organize the homecoming celebrations for Peeta and me, given that the last one was close to thirty years ago.  Home! Prim and my mother! Gale! Even the thought of Prim's scruffy old cat makes me smile. Soon I will be home!  I want to get out of this bed. To see Peeta and Cinna, to find out more about what's been going on. And why shouldn't I? I feel fine. But as I start to work my way out of the band, I feel a cold liquid seeping into my vein from one of the tubes and almost immediately lose consciousness.  This happens on and off for an indeterminate amount of time. My waking, eating, and, even though I resist the impulse to try and escape the bed, being knocked out again. I seem to be in a strange, continual twilight. Only a few things register. The redheaded Avox girl has not returned since the feeding, my scars are disappearing, and do I imagine it? Or do I hear a man's voice yelling? Not in the Capitol accent, but in the rougher cadences of home. And I can't help having a vague, comforting feeling that someone is looking out for me.  Then finally, the time arrives when I come to and there's nothing plugged into my right arm. The restraint around my middle has been removed and I am free to move about. I start to sit up but am arrested by the sight of my hands. The skin's perfection, smooth and glowing. Not only are the scars from the arena gone, but those accumulated over years of hunting have vanished without a trace. My forehead feels like satin, and when I try to find the burn on my calf, there's nothing.  I slip my legs out of bed, nervous about how they will bear my weight and find them strong and steady. Lying at the foot of the bed is an outfit that makes me flinch. It's what all of us tributes wore in the arena. I stare at it as if it had teeth until I remember that, of course, this is what I will wear to greet my team.  I'm dressed in less than a minute and fidgeting in front of the wall where I know there's a door even if I can't see it when suddenly it slides open. I step into a wide, deserted hall that appears to have no other doors on it. But it must. And behind one of them must be Peeta. Now that I'm conscious and moving, I'm growing more and more anxious about him. He must be all right or the Avox girl wouldn't have said so. But I need to see him for myself.  ""Peeta!"" I call out, since there's no one to ask. I hear my name in response, but it's not his voice. It's a voice that provokes first irritation and then eagerness. Effie.  I turn and see them all waiting in a big chamber at the end of the hall  -  Effie, Haymitch, and Cinna. My feet take off without hesitation. Maybe a victor should show more restraint, more superiority, especially when she knows this will be on tape, but I don't care. I run for them and surprise even myself when I launch into Haymitch's arms first. When he whispers in my ear, ""Nice job, sweetheart,"" it doesn't sound sarcastic. Effie's somewhat teary and keeps patting my hair and talking about how she told everyone we were pearls. Cinna just hugs me tight and doesn't say anything. Then I notice Portia is absent and get a bad feeling.  ""Where's Portia? Is she with Peeta? He is all right, isn't he? I mean, he's alive?"" I blurt out.  ""He's fine. Only they want to do your reunion live on air at the ceremony,"" says Haymitch.  ""Oh. That's all,"" I say. The awful moment of thinking Peeta's dead again passes. ""I guess I'd want to see that myself.""  ""Go on with Cinna. He has to get you ready,"" says Haymitch.  It's a relief to be alone with Cinna, to feel his protective arm around my shoulders as he guides me away from the cameras, down a few passages and to an elevator that leads to the lobby of the Training Center. The hospital then is far underground, even beneath the gym where the tributes practiced tying knots and throwing spears. The windows of the lobby are darkened, and a handful of guards stand on duty. No one else is there to see us cross to the tribute elevator. Our footsteps echo in the emptiness. And when we ride up to the twelfth floor, the faces of all the tributes who will never return flash across my mind and there's a heavy, tight place in my chest.  When the elevator doors open, Venia, Flavius, and Octavia engulf me, talking so quickly and ecstatically I can't make out their words. The sentiment is clear though. They are truly thrilled to see me and I'm happy to see them, too, although not like I was to see Cinna. It's more in the way one might be glad to see an affectionate trio of pets at the end of a particularly difficult day.  They sweep me into the dining room and I get a real meal  -  roast beef and peas and soft rolls  -  although my portions are still being strictly controlled. Because when I ask for seconds, I'm refused.  ""No, no, no. They don't want it all coming back up on the stage,"" says Octavia, but she secretly slips me an extra roll under the table to let me know she's on my side.  We go back to my room and Cinna disappears for a while as the prep team gets me ready.  ""Oh, they did a full body polish on you,"" says Flavius enviously. ""Not a flaw left on your skin.""  But when I look at my naked body in the mirror, all I can see is how skinny I am. I mean, I'm sure I was worse when I came out of the arena, but I can easily count my ribs.  They take care of the shower settings for me, and they go to work on my hair, nails, and makeup when I'm done. They chatter so continuously that I barely have to reply, which is good, since I don't feel very talkative. It's funny, because even though they're rattling on about the Games, it's all about where they were or what they were doing or how they felt when a specific event occurred. ""I was still in bed!"" ""I had just had my eyebrows dyed!"" ""I swear I nearly fainted!"" Everything is about them, not the dying boys and girls in the arena.  We don't wallow around in the Games this way in District 12. We grit our teeth and watch because we must and try to get back to business as soon as possible when they're over. To keep from hating the prep team, I effectively tune out most of what they're saying.  Cinna comes in with what appears to be an unassuming yellow dress across his arms.  ""Have you given up the whole 'girl on fire' thing?"" I ask.  ""You tell me,"" he says, and slips it over my head. I immediately notice the padding over my breasts, adding curves that hunger has stolen from my body. My hands go to my chest and I frown.  ""I know,"" says Cinna before I can object. ""But the Gamemakers wanted to alter you surgically. Haymitch had a huge fight with them over it. This was the compromise."" He stops me before I can look at my reflection. ""Wait, don't forget the shoes."" Venia helps me into a pair of flat leather sandals and I turn to the mirror.  I am still the ""girl on fire."" The sheer fabric softly glows. Even the slight movement in the air sends a ripple up my body. By comparison, the chariot costume seems garish, the interview dress too contrived. In this dress, I give the illusion of wearing candlelight.  ""What do you think?"" asks Cinna.  ""I think it's the best yet,"" I say. When I manage to pull my eyes away from the flickering fabric, I'm in for something of a shock. My hair's loose, held back by a simple hairband. The makeup rounds and fills out the sharp angles of my face. A clear polish coats my nails. The sleeveless dress is gathered at my ribs, not my waist, largely eliminating any help the padding would have given my figure. The hem falls just to my knees. Without heels, you can see my true stature. I look, very simply, like a girl. A young one. Fourteen at the most. Innocent. Harmless. Yes, it is shocking that Cinna has pulled this off when you remember I've just won the Games.  This is a very calculated look. Nothing Cinna designs is arbitrary. I bite my lip trying to figure out his motivation.  ""I thought it'd be something more. sophisticated-looking,"" I say.  ""I thought Peeta would like this better,"" he answers carefully.  Peeta? No, it's not about Peeta. It's about the Capitol and the Gamemakers and the audience. Although I do not yet understand Cinna's design, it's a reminder the Games are not quite finished. And beneath his benign reply, I sense a warning. Of something he can't even mention in front of his own team.  We take the elevator to the level where we trained. It's customary for the victor and his or her support team to rise from beneath the stage. First the prep team, followed by the escort, the stylist, the mentor, and finally the victor. Only this year, with two victors who share both an escort and a mentor, the whole thing has had to be rethought. I find myself in a poorly lit area under the stage. A brand-new metal plate has been installed to transport me upward. You can still see small piles of sawdust, smell fresh paint. Cinna and the prep team peel off to change into their own costumes and take their positions, leaving me alone. In the gloom, I see a makeshift wall about ten yards away and assume Peeta's behind it.  The rumbling of the crowd is loud, so I don't notice Haymitch until he touches my shoulder. I spring away, startled, still half in the arena, I guess.  ""Easy, just me. Let's have a look at you,"" Haymitch says. I hold out my arms and turn once. ""Good enough.""  It's not much of a compliment. ""But what?"" I say.  Haymitch's eyes shift around my musty holding space, and he seems to make a decision. ""But nothing. How about a hug for luck?""  Okay, that's an odd request from Haymitch but, after all, we are victors. Maybe a hug for luck is in order. Only, when I put my arms around his neck, I find myself trapped in his embrace. He begins talking, very fast, very quietly in my ear, my hair concealing his lips.  ""Listen up. You're in trouble. Word is the Capitol's furious about you showing them up in the arena. The one thing they can't stand is being laughed at and they're the joke of Panem,"" says Haymitch.  I feel dread coursing through me now, but I laugh as though Haymitch is saying something completely delightful because nothing is covering my mouth. ""So, what?""  ""Your only defense can be you were so madly in love you weren't responsible for your actions."" Haymitch pulls back and adjusts my hairband. ""Got it, sweetheart?"" He could be talking about anything now.  ""Got it,"" I say. ""Did you tell Peeta this?""  ""Don't have to,"" says Haymitch. ""He's already there.""  ""But you think I'm not?"" I say, taking the opportunity to straighten a bright red bow tie Cinna must have wrestled him into.  ""Since when does it matter what I think?"" says Haymitch. ""Better take our places."" He leads me to the metal circle. ""This is your night, sweetheart. Enjoy it."" He kisses me on the forehead and disappears into the gloom.  I tug on my skirt, willing it to be longer, wanting it to cover the knocking in my knees. Then I realize it's pointless. My whole body's shaking like a leaf. Hopefully, it will be put down to excitement. After all, it's my night.  The damp, moldy smell beneath the stage threatens to choke me. A cold, clammy sweat breaks out on my skin and I can't rid myself of the feeling that the boards above my head are about to collapse, to bury me alive under the rubble. When I left the arena, when the trumpets played, I was supposed to be safe. From then on. For the rest of my life. But if what Haymitch says is true, and he's got no reason to lie, I've never been in such a dangerous place in my life.  It's so much worse than being hunted in the arena. There, I could only die. End of story. But out here Prim, my mother, Gale, the people of District 12, everyone I care about back home could be punished if I can't pull off the girl-driven-crazy-by-love scenario Haymitch has suggested.  So I still have a chance, though. Funny, in the arena, when I poured out those berries, I was only thinking of outsmarting the Gamemakers, not how my actions would reflect on the Capitol. But the Hunger Games are their weapon and you are not supposed to be able to defeat it. So now the Capitol will act as if they've been in control the whole time. As if they orchestrated the whole event, right down to the double suicide. But that will only work if I play along with them.  And Peeta. Peeta will suffer, too, if this goes wrong. But what was it Haymitch said when I asked if he had told Peeta the situation? That he had to pretend to be desperately in love?  ""Don't have to. He's already there.""  Already thinking ahead of me in the Games again and well aware of the danger we're in? Or. already desperately in love? I don't know. I haven't even begun to separate out my feelings about Peeta. It's too complicated. What I did as part of the Games. As opposed to what I did out of anger at the Capitol. Or because of how it would be viewed back in District 12. Or simply because it was the only decent thing to do. Or what I did because I cared about him.  These are questions to be unraveled back home, in the peace and quiet of the woods, when no one is watching. Not here with every eye upon me. But I won't have that luxury for who knows how long. And right now, the most dangerous part of the Hunger Games is about to begin."
Hunger Games Chapter 27,"The anthem booms in my ears, and then I hear Caesar Flickerman greeting the audience. Does he know how crucial it is to get every word right from now on? He must. He will want to help us. The crowd breaks into applause as the prep teams are presented. I imagine Flavius, Venia, and Octavia bouncing around and taking ridiculous, bobbing bows. It's a safe bet they're clueless. Then Effie's introduced. How long she's waited for this moment. I hope she's able to enjoy it because as misguided as Effie can be, she has a very keen instinct about certain things and must at least suspect we're in trouble. Portia and Cinna receive huge cheers, of course, they've been brilliant, had a dazzling debut. I now understand Cinna's choice of dress for me for tonight. I'll need to look as girlish and innocent as possible. Haymitch's appearance brings a round of stomping that goes on at least five minutes. Well, he's accomplished a first. Keeping not only one but two tributes alive. What if he hadn't warned me in time? Would I have acted differently? Flaunted the moment with the berries in the Capitol's face? No, I don't think so. But I could easily have been a lot less convincing than I need to be now. Right now. Because I can feel the plate lifting me up to the stage.  Blinding lights. The deafening roar rattles the metal under my feet. Then there's Peeta just a few yards away. He looks so clean and healthy and beautiful, I can hardly recognize him. But his smile is the same whether in mud or in the Capitol and when I see it, I take about three steps and fling myself into his arms. He staggers back, almost losing his balance, and that's when I realize the slim, metal contraption in his hand is some kind of cane. He rights himself and we just cling to each other while the audience goes insane. He's kissing me and all the time I'm thinking, Do you know? Do you know how much danger we're in? After about ten minutes of this, Caesar Flickerman taps on his shoulder to continue the show, and Peeta just pushes him aside without even glancing at him. The audience goes berserk. Whether he knows or not, Peeta is, as usual, playing the crowd exactly right.  Finally, Haymitch interrupts us and gives us a good-natured shove toward the victor's chair. Usually, this is a single, ornate chair from which the winning tribute watches a film of the highlights of the Games, but since there are two of us, the Gamemakers have provided a plush red velvet couch. A small one, my mother would call it a love seat, I think. I sit so close to Peeta that I'm practically on his lap, but one look from Haymitch tells me it isn't enough. Kicking off my sandals, I tuck my feet to the side and lean my head against Peeta's shoulder. His arm goes around me automatically, and I feel like I'm back in the cave, curled up against him, trying to keep warm. His shirt is made of the same yellow material as my dress, but Portia's put him in long black pants. No sandals, either, but a pair of sturdy black boots he keeps solidly planted on the stage. I wish Cinna had given me a similar outfit, I feel so vulnerable in this flimsy dress. But I guess that was the point.  Caesar Flickerman makes a few more jokes, and then it's time for the show. This will last exactly three hours and is required viewing for all of Panem. As the lights dim and the seal appears on the screen, I realize I'm unprepared for this. I do not want to watch my twenty-two fellow tributes die. I saw enough of them die the first time. My heart starts pounding and I have a strong impulse to run. How have the other victors faced this alone? During the highlights, they periodically show the winner's reaction up on a box in the corner of the screen. I think back to earlier years. some are triumphant, pumping their fists in the air, beating their chests. Most just seem stunned. All I know is that the only thing keeping me on this love seat is Peeta  -  his arm around my shoulder, his other hand claimed by both of mine. Of course, the previous victors didn't have the Capitol looking for a way to destroy them.  Condensing several weeks into three hours is quite a feat, especially when you consider how many cameras were going at once. Whoever puts together the highlights has to choose what sort of story to tell. This year, for the first time, they tell a love story. I know Peeta and I won, but a disproportionate amount of time is spent on us, right from the beginning. I'm glad though, because it supports the whole crazy-in-love thing that's my defense for defying the Capitol, plus it means we won't have as much time to linger over the deaths.  The first half hour or so focuses on the pre-arena events, the reaping, the chariot ride through the Capitol, our training scores, and our interviews. There's this sort of upbeat soundtrack playing under it that makes it twice as awful because, of course, almost everyone on-screen is dead.  Once we're in the arena, there's detailed coverage of the bloodbath and then the filmmakers basically alternate between shots of tributes dying and shots of us. Mostly Peeta really, there's no question he's carrying this romance thing on his shoulders. Now I see what the audience saw, how he misled the Careers about me, stayed awake the entire night under the tracker jacker tree, fought Cato to let me escape and even while he lay in that mud bank, whispered my name in his sleep. I seem heartless in comparison  -  dodging fireballs, dropping nests, and blowing up supplies  -  until I go hunting for Rue. They play her death in full, the spearing, my failed rescue attempt, my arrow through the boy from District 1's throat, Rue drawing her last breath in my arms. And the song. I get to sing every note of the song. Something inside me shuts down and I'm too numb to feel anything. It's like watching complete strangers in another Hunger Games. But I do notice they omit the part where I covered her in flowers.  Right. Because even that smacks of rebellion.  Things pick up for me once they've announced two tributes from the same district can live and I shout out Peeta's name and then clap my hands over my mouth. If I've seemed indifferent to him earlier, I make up for it now, by finding him, nursing him back to health, going to the feast for the medicine, and being very free with my kisses. Objectively, I can see the mutts and Cato's death are as gruesome as ever, but again, I feel it happens to people I have never met.  And then comes the moment with the berries. I can hear the audience hushing one another, not wanting to miss anything. A wave of gratitude to the filmmakers sweeps over me when they end not with the announcement of our victory, but with me pounding on the glass door of the hovercraft, screaming Peeta's name as they try to revive him.  In terms of survival, it's my best moment all night.  The anthem's playing yet again and we rise as President Snow himself takes the stage followed by a little girl carrying a cushion that holds the crown. There's just one crown, though, and you can hear the crowd's confusion  -  whose head will he place it on?  -  until President Snow gives it a twist and it separates into two halves. He places the first around Peeta's brow with a smile. He's still smiling when he settles the second on my head, but his eyes, just inches from mine, are as unforgiving as a snake's.  That's when I know that even though both of us would have eaten the berries, I am to blame for having the idea. I'm the instigator. I'm the one to be punished.  Much bowing and cheering follows. My arm is about to fall off from waving when Caesar Flickerman finally bids the audience good night, reminding them to tune in tomorrow for the final interviews. As if they have a choice.  Peeta and I are whisked to the president's mansion for the Victory Banquet, where we have very little time to eat as Capitol officials and particularly generous sponsors elbow one another out of the way as they try to get their picture with us. Face after beaming face flashes by, becoming increasingly intoxicated as the evening wears on. Occasionally, I catch a glimpse of Haymitch, which is reassuring, or President Snow, which is terrifying, but I keep laughing and thanking people and smiling as my picture is taken. The one thing I never do is let go of Peeta's hand.  The sun is just peeking over the horizon when we straggle back to the twelfth floor of the Training Center. I think now I'll finally get a word alone with Peeta, but Haymitch sends him off with Portia to get something fitted for the interview and personally escorts me to my door.  ""Why can't I talk to him?"" I ask.  ""Plenty of time for talk when we get home,"" says Haymitch. ""Go to bed, you're on air at two.""  Despite Haymitch's running interference, I'm determined to see Peeta privately. After I toss and turn for a few hours, I slip into the hall. My first thought is to check the roof, but it's empty. Even the city streets far below are deserted after the celebration last night. I go back to bed for a while and then decide to go directly to his room, but when I try to turn the knob, I find my own bedroom door has been locked from the outside. I suspect Haymitch initially, but then there's a more insidious fear that the Capitol may by monitoring and confining me. I've been unable to escape since the Hunger Games began, but this feels different, much more personal. This feels like I've been imprisoned for a crime and I'm awaiting sentencing. I quickly get back in bed and pretend to sleep until Effie Trinket comes to alert me to the start of another ""big, big, big day!""  I have about five minutes to eat a bowl of hot grain and stew before the prep team descends. All I have to say is, ""The crowd loved you!"" and it's unnecessary to speak for the next couple of hours. When Cinna comes in, he shoos them out and dresses me in a white, gauzy dress and pink shoes. Then he personally adjusts my makeup until I seem to radiate a soft, rosy glow. We make idle chitchat, but I'm afraid to ask him anything of real importance because after the incident with the door, I can't shake the feeling that I'm being watched constantly.  The interview takes place right down the hall in the sitting room. A space has been cleared and the love seat has been moved in and surrounded by vases of red and pink roses. There are only a handful of cameras to record the event. No live audience at least.  Caesar Flickerman gives me a warm hug when I. come in. ""Congratulations, Katniss. How are you faring?""  ""Fine. Nervous about the interview,"" I say.  ""Don't be. We're going to have a fabulous time,"" he says, giving my cheek a reassuring pat.  ""I'm not good at talking about myself,"" I say.  ""Nothing you say will be wrong,"" he says.  And I think, Oh, Caesar, if only that were true. But actually, President Snow may be arranging some sort of ""accident"" for me as we speak.  Then Peeta's there looking handsome in red and white, pulling me off to the side. ""I hardly get to see you. Haymitch seems bent on keeping us apart.""  Haymitch is actually bent on keeping us alive, but there are too many ears listening, so I just say, ""Yes, he's gotten very responsible lately.""  ""Well, there's just this and we go home. Then he can't watch us all the time,"" says Peeta.  I feel a sort of shiver run through me and there's no time to analyze why, because they're ready for us. We sit somewhat formally on the love seat, but Caesar says, ""Oh, go ahead and curl up next to him if you want. It looked very sweet."" So I tuck my feet up and Peeta pulls me in close to him.  Someone counts backward and just like that, we're being broadcast live to the entire country. Caesar Flickerman is wonderful, teasing, joking, getting choked up when the occasion presents itself. He and Peeta already have the rapport they established that night of the first interview, that easy banter, so I just smile a lot and try to speak as little as possible. I mean, I have to talk some, but as soon as I can I redirect the conversation back to Peeta.  Eventually though, Caesar begins to pose questions that insist on fuller answers. ""Well, Peeta, we know, from our days in the cave, that it was love at first sight for you from what, age five?"" Caesar says.  ""From the moment I laid eyes on her,"" says Peeta.  ""But, Katniss, what a ride for you. I think the real excitement for the audience was watching you fall for him. When did you realize you were in love with him?"" asks Caesar.  ""Oh, that's a hard one. "" I give a faint, breathy laugh and look down at my hands. Help.  ""Well, I know when it hit me. The night when you shouted out his name from that tree,"" says Caesar.  Thank you, Caesar! I think, and then go with his idea. ""Yes, I guess that was it. I mean, until that point, I just tried not to think about what my feelings might be, honestly, because it was so confusing and it only made things worse if I actually cared about him. But then, in the tree, everything changed,"" I say.  ""Why do you think that was?"" urges Caesar.  ""Maybe. because for the first time. there was a chance I could keep him,"" I say.  Behind a cameraman, I see Haymitch give a sort of huff with relief and I know I've said the right thing. Caesar pulls out a handkerchief and has to take a moment because he's so moved. I can feel Peeta press his forehead into my temple and he asks, ""So now that you've got me, what are you going to do with me?""  I turn in to him. ""Put you somewhere you can't get hurt."" And when he kisses me, people in the room actually sigh.  For Caesar, this is a natural place to segue into all the ways we did get hurt in the arena, from burns, to stings, to wounds. But it's not until we get around to the mutts that I forget I'm on camera. When Caesar asks Peeta how his ""new leg"" is working out.  ""New leg?"" I say, and I can't help reaching out and pulling up the bottom of Peeta's pants. ""Oh, no,"" I whisper, taking in the metal-and-plastic device that has replaced his flesh.  ""No one told you?"" asks Caesar gently. I shake my head.  ""I haven't had the chance,"" says Peeta with a slight shrug.  ""It's my fault,"" I say. ""Because I used that tourniquet.""  ""Yes, it's your fault I'm alive,"" says Peeta.  ""He's right,"" says Caesar. ""He'd have bled to death for sure without it.""  I guess this is true, but I can't help feeling upset about it to the extent that I'm afraid I might cry and then I remember everyone in the country is watching me so I just bury my face in Peeta's shirt. It takes them a couple of minutes to coax me back out because it's better in the shirt, where no one can see me, and when I do come out, Caesar backs off questioning me so I can recover. In fact, he pretty much leaves me alone until the berries come up.  ""Katniss, I know you've had a shock, but I've got to ask. The moment when you pulled out those berries. What was going on in your mind. hm?"" he says.  I take a long pause before I answer, trying to collect my thoughts. This is the crucial moment where I either challenged the Capitol or went so crazy at the idea of losing Peeta that I can't be held responsible for my actions. It seems to call for a big, dramatic speech, but all I get out is one almost inaudible sentence. ""I don't know, I just. couldn't bear the thought of. being without him.""  ""Peeta? Anything to add?"" asks Caesar.  ""No. I think that goes for both of us,"" he says.  Caesar signs off and it's over. Everyone's laughing and crying and hugging, but I'm still not sure until I reach Haymitch. ""Okay?"" I whisper.  ""Perfect,"" he answers.  I go back to my room to collect a few things and find there's nothing to take but the mockingjay pin Madge gave me. Someone returned it to my room after the Games. They drive us through the streets in a car with blackened windows, and the train's waiting for us. We barely have time to say good-bye to Cinna and Portia, although we'll see them in a few months, when we tour the districts for a round of victory ceremonies. It's the Capitol's way of reminding people that the Hunger Games never really go away. We'll be given a lot of useless plaques, and everyone will have to pretend they love us.  The train begins moving and we're plunged into night until we clear the tunnel and I take my first free breath since the reaping. Effie is accompanying us back and Haymitch, too, of course. We eat an enormous dinner and settle into silence in front of the television to watch a replay of the interview. With the Capitol growing farther away every second, I begin to think of home. Of Prim and my mother. Of Gale. I excuse myself to change out of my dress and into a plain shirt and pants. As I slowly, thoroughly wash the makeup from my face and put my hair in its braid, I begin transforming back into myself. Katniss Everdeen. A girl who lives in the Seam. Hunts in the woods. Trades in the Hob. I stare in the mirror as I try to remember who I am and who I am not. By the time I join the others, the pressure of Peeta's arm around my shoulders feels alien.  When the train makes a brief stop for fuel, we're allowed to go outside for some fresh air. There's no longer any need to guard us. Peeta and I walk down along the track, hand in hand, and I can't find anything to say now that we're alone. He stops to gather a bunch of wildflowers for me. When he presents them, I work hard to look pleased. Because he can't know that the pink-and-white flowers are the tops of wild onions and only remind me of the hours I've spent gathering them with Gale.  Gale. The idea of seeing Gale in a matter of hours makes my stomach churn. But why? I can't quite frame it in my mind. I only know that I feel like I've been lying to someone who trusts me. Or more accurately, to two people. I've been getting away with it up to this point because of the Games. But there will be no Games to hide behind back home.  ""What's wrong?"" Peeta asks.  ""Nothing,"" I answer. We continue walking, past the end of the train, out where even I'm fairly sure there are no cameras hidden in the scrubby bushes along the track. Still no words come.  Haymitch startles me when he lays a hand on my back. Even now, in the middle of nowhere, he keeps his voice down. ""Great job, you two. Just keep it up in the district until the cameras are gone. We should be okay."" I watch him head back to the train, avoiding Peeta's eyes.  ""What's he mean?"" Peeta asks me.  ""It's the Capitol. They didn't like our stunt with the berries,"" I blurt out.  ""What? What are you talking about?"" he says.  ""It seemed too rebellious. So, Haymitch has been coaching me through the last few days. So I didn't make it worse,"" I say.  ""Coaching you? But not me,"" says Peeta.  ""He knew you were smart enough to get it right,"" I say.  ""I didn't know there was anything to get right,"" says Peeta. ""So, what you're saying is, these last few days and then I guess. back in the arena. that was just some strategy you two worked out.""  ""No. I mean, I couldn't even talk to him in the arena, could I?"" I stammer.  ""But you knew what he wanted you to do, didn't you?"" says Peeta. I bite my lip. ""Katniss?"" He drops my hand and I take a step, as if to catch my balance.  ""It was all for the Games,"" Peeta says. ""How you acted.""  ""Not all of it,"" I say, tightly holding onto my flowers.  ""Then how much? No, forget that. I guess the real question is what's going to be left when we get home?"" he says.  ""I don't know. The closer we get to District Twelve, the more confused I get,"" I say. He waits, for further explanation, but none's forthcoming.  ""Well, let me know when you work it out,"" he says, and the pain in his voice is palpable.  I know my ears are healed because, even with the rumble of the engine, I can hear every step he takes back to the train. By the time I've climbed aboard, Peeta has disappiared into his room for the night. I don't see him the next morning, either. In fact, the next time he turns up, we're pulling into District 12. He gives me a nod, his face expressionless.  I want to tell him that he's not being fair. That we were strangers. That I did what it took to stay alive, to keep us both alive in the arena. That I can't explain how things are with Gale because I don't know myself. That it's no good loving me because I'm never going to get married anyway and he'd just end up hating me later instead of sooner. That if I do have feelings for him, it doesn't matter because I'll never be able to afford the kind of love that leads to a family, to children. And how can he? How can he after what we've just been through?  I also want to tell him how much I already miss him. But that wouldn't be fair on my part.  So we just stand there silently, watching our grimy little station rise up around us. Through the window, I can see the platform's thick with cameras. Everyone will be eagerly watching our homecoming.  Out of the corner of my eye, I see Peeta extend his hand. I look at him, unsure. ""One more time? For the audience?"" he says. His voice isn't angry. It's hollow, which is worse. Already the boy with the bread is slipping away from me.  I take his hand, holding on tightly, preparing for the cameras, and dreading the moment when I will finally have to let go."
Harry Potter 1 Chapter 1,"Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.  Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.  The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that.  When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.  None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.  At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.  ""Little tyke,"" chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive.  It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn't a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats couldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.  But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something... yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.  Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn't see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.  He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.  ""The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard--""  ""-- yes, their son, Harry--""  Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.  He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry. He'd never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn't blame her -- if he'd had a sister like that... but all the same, those people in cloaks...  He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.  ""Sorry,"" he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, ""Don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!""  And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.  Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn't approve of imagination.  As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw -- and it didn't improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.  ""Shoo!"" said Mr. Dursley loudly.  The cat didn't move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.  Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (""Won't!""). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:  ""And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern."" The newscaster allowed himself a grin. ""Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?""  ""Well, Ted,"" said the weatherman, ""I don't know about that, but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it's not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.""  Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters...  Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He'd have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. ""Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you?""  As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn't have a sister.  ""No,"" she said sharply. ""Why?""  ""Funny stuff on the news,"" Mr. Dursley mumbled. ""Owls... shooting stars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today...""  ""So?"" snapped Mrs. Dursley.  ""Well, I just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you know... her crowd.""  Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name ""Potter."" He decided he didn't dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, ""Their son -- he'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?""  ""I suppose so,"" said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.  ""What's his name again? Howard, isn't it?""  ""Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.""  ""Oh, yes,"" said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. ""Yes, I quite agree.""  He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.  Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did... if it got out that they were related to a pair of -- well, he didn't think he could bear it.  The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind... He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on -- he yawned and turned over -- it couldn't affect them...  How very wrong he was.  Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.  A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground. The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.  Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man's name was Albus Dumbledore.  Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, ""I should have known.""  He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn't look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it.  ""Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.""  He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.  ""How did you know it was me?"" she asked.  ""My dear Professor, I've never seen a cat sit so stiffly.""  ""You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day,"" said Professor McGonagall.  ""All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.""  Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.  ""Oh yes, I've celebrating, all right,"" she said impatiently. ""You'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no -- even the Muggles have noticed something's going on. It was on their news."" She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living-room window. ""I heard it. Flocks of owls... shooting stars... Well, they're not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent -- I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.""  ""You can't blame them,"" said Dumbledore gently. ""We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.""  ""I know that,"" said Professor McGonagall irritably. ""But that's no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.""  She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn't, so she went on. ""A fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?""  ""It certainly seems so,"" said Dumbledore. ""We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?""  ""A what?""  ""A lemon drop. They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of.""  ""No, thank you,"" said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops. ""As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone--""  ""My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this 'You-Know-Who' nonsense -- for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort."" Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. ""It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You-Know-Who.' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name.""  ""I know you haven't, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. ""But you're different. Everyone knows you're the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.""  ""You flatter me,"" said Dumbledore calmly. ""Voldemort had powers I will never have.""  ""Only because you're too -- well -- noble to use them.""  ""It's lucky it's dark. I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.""  Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said ""The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what they're saying? About why he's disappeared? About what finally stopped him?""  It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever ""everyone"" was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.  ""What they're saying,"" she pressed on, ""is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that they're -- dead.""  Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.  ""Lily and James... I can't believe it... I didn't want to believe it... Oh, Albus...""  Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. ""I know... I know... "" he said heavily.  Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on. ""That's not all. They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son, Harry. But he couldn't. He couldn't kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter, Voldemort's power somehow broke -- and that's why he's gone.""  Dumbledore nodded glumly.  ""It's -- it's true ?"" faltered Professor McGonagall. ""After all he's done... all the people he's killed... he couldn't kill a little boy? It's just astounding... of all the things to stop him... but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?""  ""We can only guess,"" said Dumbledore. ""We may never know.""  Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, ""Hagrid's late. I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here, by the way?""  ""Yes,"" said Professor McGonagall. ""And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here, of all places?""  ""I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They're the only family he has left now.""  ""You don't mean - you can't mean the people who live here ?"" cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. ""Dumbledore -- you can't. I've been watching them all day. You couldn't find two people who are less like us. And they've got this son -- I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!""  ""It's the best place for him,"" said Dumbledore firmly. ""His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older. I've written them a letter.""  ""A letter?"" repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. ""Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He'll be famous -- a legend -- I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future -- there will be books written about Harry -- every child in our world will know his name!""  ""Exactly."" said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. ""It would be enough to turn any boy's head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won't even remember! Can you see how much better off he'll be, growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it?""  Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, ""Yes -- yes, you're right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?"" She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.  ""Hagrid's bringing him.""  ""You think it -- wise -- to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?""  ""I would trust Hagrid with my life,"" said Dumbledore.  ""I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place,"" said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, ""but you can't pretend he's not careless. He does tend to -- what was that?""  A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky -- and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.  If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild -- long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets.  ""Hagrid,"" said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. ""At last. And where did you get that motorcycle?""  ""Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,"" said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. ""Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I've got him, sir.""  ""No problems, were there?""  ""No, sir -- house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around. He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol.""  Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.  ""Is that where -- ?"" whispered Professor McGonagall.  ""Yes,"" said Dumbledore. ""He'll have that scar forever.""  ""Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?""  ""Even if I could, I wouldn't. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well -- give him here, Hagrid -- we'd better get this over with.""  Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house.  ""Could I -- could I say good-bye to him, sir?"" asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.  ""Shhh!"" hissed Professor McGonagall, ""You'll wake the Muggles!""  ""S-s-sorry,"" sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. ""But I c-c-can't stand it -- Lily an' James dead -- an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles--""  ""Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we'll be found,"" Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry's blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid's shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out.  ""Well,"" said Dumbledore finally, ""that's that. We've no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.""  ""Yeah,"" said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, ""I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back. G'night, Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore, sir.""  Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.  ""I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,"" said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.  Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.  ""Good luck, Harry,"" he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.  A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs. Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley... He couldn't know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: ""To Harry Potter -- the boy who lived!"""
Harry Potter 1 Chapter 2,"Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -- but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.  Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.  ""Up! Get up! Now!""  Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.  ""Up!"" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he'd had the same dream before.  His aunt was back outside the door.  ""Are you up yet?"" she demanded.  ""Nearly,"" said Harry.  ""Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don't you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday.""  Harry groaned.  ""What did you say?"" his aunt snapped through the door.  ""Nothing, nothing...""  Dudley's birthday -- how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.  When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise -- unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him. Harry didn't look it, but he was very fast.  Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.  ""In the car crash when your parents died,"" she had said. ""And don't ask questions.""  Don't ask questions -- that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys.  Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.  ""Comb your hair!"" he barked, by way of a morning greeting.  About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way -- all over the place.  Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel -- Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.  Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn't much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell.  ""Thirty-six,"" he said, looking up at his mother and father. ""That's two less than last year.""  ""Darling, you haven't counted Auntie Marge's present, see, it's here under this big one from Mummy and Daddy.""  ""All right, thirty-seven then,"" said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.  Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, ""And we'll buy you another two presents while we're out today. How's that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right""  Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, ""So I'll have thirty... thirty...""  ""Thirty-nine, sweetums,"" said Aunt Petunia.  ""Oh."" Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. ""All right then.""  Uncle Vernon chuckled.  ""Little tyke wants his money's worth, just like his father. 'Atta boy, Dudley!"" He ruffled Dudley's hair.  At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.  ""Bad news, Vernon,"" she said. ""Mrs. Figg's broken her leg. She can't take him."" She jerked her head in Harry's direction.  Dudley's mouth fell open in horror, but Harry's heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley's birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever owned.  ""Now what?"" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he'd planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn't easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.  ""We could phone Marge,"" Uncle Vernon suggested.  ""Don't be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.""  The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn't there -- or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn't understand them, like a slug.  ""What about what's-her-name, your friend -- Yvonne?""  ""On vacation in Majorca,"" snapped Aunt Petunia.  ""You could just leave me here,"" Harry put in hopefully (he'd be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley's computer).  Aunt Petunia looked as though she'd just swallowed a lemon.  ""And come back and find the house in ruins?"" she snarled.  ""I won't blow up the house,"" said Harry, but they weren't listening.  ""I suppose we could take him to the zoo,"" said Aunt Petunia slowly, ""... and leave him in the car...""  ""That car's new, he's not sitting in it alone...""  Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn't really crying -- it had been years since he'd really cried -- but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted.  ""Dinky Duddydums, don't cry, Mummy won't let him spoil your special day!"" she cried, flinging her arms around him.  ""I... don't... want... him... t-t-to come!"" Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. ""He always sp-spoils everything!"" He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother's arms.  Just then, the doorbell rang -- ""Oh, good Lord, they're here!"" said Aunt Petunia frantically -- and a moment later, Dudley's best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people's arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.  Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn't been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.  ""I'm warning you,"" he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry's, ""I'm warning you now, boy -- any funny business, anything at all -- and you'll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.""  ""I'm not going to do anything,"" said Harry, ""honestly...""  But Uncle Vernon didn't believe him. No one ever did.  The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn't make them happen.  Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn't been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left ""to hide that horrible scar."" Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly.  Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley's (brown with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn't punished.  On the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley's gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he'd tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump.  But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn't school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg's cabbage-smelling living room.  While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles.  ""... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,"" he said, as a motorcycle overtook them.  ""I had a dream about a motorcycle,"" said Harry, remembering suddenly. ""It was flying.""  Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: ""MOTORCYCLES DON'T FLY!""  Dudley and Piers sniggered.  ""I know they don't,"" said Harry. ""It was only a dream.""  But he wished he hadn't said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn't, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon -- they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas.  It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn't bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn't blond.  Harry had the best morning he'd had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn't fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn't have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.  Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last.  After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon's car and crushed it into a trash can -- but at the moment it didn't look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.  Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils.  ""Make it move,"" he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn't budge.  ""Do it again,"" Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.  ""This is boring,"" Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.  Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself -- no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.  The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's.  It winked.  Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren't. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.  The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:  ""I get that all the time.""  ""I know,"" Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn't sure the snake could hear him. ""It must be really annoying.""  The snake nodded vigorously.  ""Where do you come from, anyway?"" Harry asked.  The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it.  Boa Constrictor, Brazil.  ""Was it nice there?""  The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. ""Oh, I see -- so you've never been to Brazil?""  As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump. ""DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT IT'S DOING!""  Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.  ""Out of the way, you,"" he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror.  Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits.  As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, ""Brazil, here I come... Thanksss, amigo.""  The keeper of the reptile house was in shock.  ""But the glass,"" he kept saying, ""where did the glass go?""  The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, ""Harry was talking to it, weren't you, Harry?""  Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, ""Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals,"" before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.  Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food.  He'd lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he'd been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn't remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn't remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house.  When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look.  At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang."
Harry Potter 1 Chapter 3,"The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.  Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley's gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley's favorite sport: Harry Hunting.  This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn't be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon's old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny.  ""They stuff people's heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,"" he told Harry. ""Want to come upstairs and practice?""  ""No, thanks,"" said Harry. ""The poor toilet's never had anything as horrible as your head down it -- it might be sick."" Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he'd said.  One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg's. Mrs. Figg wasn't as bad as usual. It turned out she'd broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn't seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she'd had it for several years.  That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings' boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren't looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.  As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn't believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn't trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.  There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.  ""What's this?"" he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question.  ""Your new school uniform,"" she said.  Harry looked in the bowl again.  ""Oh,"" he said, ""I didn't realize it had to be so wet.""  ""Don't be stupid,"" snapped Aunt Petunia. ""I'm dyeing some of Dudley's old things gray for you. It'll look just like everyone else's when I've finished.""  Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High -- like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably.  Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry's new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table.  They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat.  ""Get the mail, Dudley,"" said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.  ""Make Harry get it.""  ""Get the mail, Harry.""  ""Make Dudley get it.""  ""Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.""  Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon's sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and -- a letter for Harry.  Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives -- he didn't belong to the library, so he'd never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:  Mr. H. Potter  The Cupboard under the Stairs  4 Privet Drive  Little Whinging  Surrey  The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp.  Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H.  ""Hurry up, boy!"" shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. ""What are you doing, checking for letter bombs?"" He chuckled at his own joke.  Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope.  Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard.  ""Marge's ill,"" he informed Aunt Petunia. ""Ate a funny whelk...""  ""Dad!"" said Dudley suddenly. ""Dad, Harry's got something!""  Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon.  ""That's mine!"" said Harry, trying to snatch it back.  ""Who'd be writing to you?"" sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn't stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge.  ""P-P-Petunia!"" he gasped.  Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise.  ""Vernon! Oh my goodness -- Vernon!""  They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn't used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.  ""I want to read that letter,"" he said loudly.  ""I want to read it,"" said Harry furiously, ""as it's mine.""  ""Get out, both of you,"" croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope.  Harry didn't move.  ""I WANT MY LETTER!"" he shouted.  ""Let me see it!"" demanded Dudley.  ""OUT!"" roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor.  ""Vernon,"" Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, ""look at the address -- how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don't think they're watching the house?""  ""Watching -- spying -- might be following us,"" muttered Uncle Vernon wildly.  ""But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don't want--""  Harry could see Uncle Vernon's shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen.  ""No,"" he said finally. ""No, we'll ignore it. If they don't get an answer... Yes, that's best... we won't do anything...""  ""But--""  ""I'm not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn't we swear when we took him in we'd stamp out that dangerous nonsense?""  That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he'd never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.  ""Where's my letter?"" said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. ""Who's writing to me?""  ""No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,"" said Uncle Vernon shortly. ""I have burned it.""  ""It was not a mistake,"" said Harry angrily, ""it had my cupboard on it.""  ""SILENCE!"" yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful.  ""Er -- yes, Harry -- about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking... you're really getting a bit big for it... we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley's second bedroom.  ""Why?"" said Harry.  ""Don't ask questions!"" snapped his uncle. ""Take this stuff upstairs, now.""  The Dursleys' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn't fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor's dog; in the corner was Dudley's first-ever television set, which he'd put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though they'd never been touched.  From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I don't want him in there... I need that room... make him get out...""  Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he'd have given anything to be up here. Today he'd rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it.  Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. He'd screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn't have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he'd opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.  When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, ""There's another one! 'Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive -- '""  With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry's letter clutched in his hand.  ""Go to your cupboard -- I mean, your bedroom,"" he wheezed at Harry. ""Dudley -- go -- just go.""  Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn't received his first letter. Surely that meant they'd try again? And this time he'd make sure they didn't fail. He had a plan.  The repaired alarm clock rang at six o'clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn't wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights.  He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door --  ""AAAAARRRGH!""  Harry leapt into the air; he'd trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat -- something alive!  Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle's face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn't do exactly what he'd been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon's lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.  ""I want -- "" he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes.  Uncle Vernon didn't go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot.  ""See,"" he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, ""if they can't deliver them they'll just give up.""  ""I'm not sure that'll work, Vernon.""  ""Oh, these people's minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they're not like you and me,"" said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.  On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn't go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom.  Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed ""Tiptoe Through the Tulips"" as he worked, and jumped at small noises.  On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.  ""Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?"" Dudley asked Harry in amazement.  On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy.  ""No post on Sundays,"" he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, ""no damn letters today--""  Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one --  ""Out! OUT!""  Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.  ""That does it,"" said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. ""I want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We're going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!""  He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag.  They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn't dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while.  ""Shake 'em off... shake 'em off,"" he would mutter whenever he did this.  They didn't stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. He'd never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he'd missed five television programs he'd wanted to see, and he'd never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer.  Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering...  They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table.  ""'Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an 'undred of these at the front desk.""  She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address:  Mr. H. Potter  Room 17  Railview Hotel  Cokeworth  Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared.  ""I'll take them,"" said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room.  ""Wouldn't it be better just to go home, dear?"" Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn't seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.  ""Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?"" Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.  It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley sniveled.  ""It's Monday,"" he told his mother. ""The Great Humberto's on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television.""  Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday -- and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of television -- then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry's eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun -- last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks. Still, you weren't eleven every day.  Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn't answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he'd bought.  ""Found the perfect place!"" he said. ""Come on! Everyone out!""  It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there.  ""Storm forecast for tonight!"" said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. ""And this gentleman's kindly agreed to lend us his boat!""  A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them.  ""I've already got us some rations,"" said Uncle Vernon, ""so all aboard!""  It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house.  The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms.  Uncle Vernon's rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.  ""Could do with some of those letters now, eh?"" he said cheerfully.  He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn't cheer him up at all.  As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.  The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry couldn't sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley's snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley's watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he'd be eleven in ten minutes' time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.  Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the roof wasn't going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he'd be able to steal one somehow.  Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea?  One minute to go and he'd be eleven. Thirty seconds... twenty... ten... nine -- maybe he'd wake Dudley up, just to annoy him -- three... two... one...  BOOM.  The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in."
Harry Potter 1 Chapter 4,"BOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake.  ""Where's the cannon?"" he said stupidly.  There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the room. He was holding a rifle in his hands - now they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them.  ""Who's there?"" he shouted. ""I warn you -- I'm armed!""  There was a pause. Then --  SMASH!  The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.  A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair.  The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all.  ""Couldn't make us a cup o' tea, could yeh? It's not been an easy journey...""  He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear.  ""Budge up, yeh great lump,"" said the stranger.  Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.  ""An' here's Harry!"" said the giant.  Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.  ""Las' time I saw you, you was only a baby,"" said the giant. ""Yeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh've got yer mom's eyes.""  Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.  ""I demand that you leave at once, sir!"" he said. ""You are breaking and entering!""  ""Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,"" said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon's hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room.  Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.  ""Anyway -- Harry,"" said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, ""a very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here -- I mighta sat on it at some point, but it'll taste all right.""  From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing.  Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, ""Who are you?""  The giant chuckled.  ""True, I haven't introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.""  He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry's whole arm.  ""What about that tea then, eh?"" he said, rubbing his hands together. ""I'd not say no ter summat stronger if yeh've got it, mind.""  His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn't see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he'd sunk into a hot bath.  The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, ""Don't touch anything he gives you, Dudley.""  The giant chuckled darkly.  ""Yer great puddin' of a son don' need fattenin' anymore, Dursley, don' worry.""  He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn't take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, ""I'm sorry, but I still don't really know who you are.""  The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.  ""Call me Hagrid,"" he said, ""everyone does. An' like I told yeh, I'm Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts -- yeh'll know all about Hogwarts, o' course.  ""Er -- no,"" said Harry.  Hagrid looked shocked.  ""Sorry,"" Harry said quickly.  ""Sorry ?"" barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. ""It's them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren't gettin' yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn't even know abou' Hogwarts, fer cryin' out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yer parents learned it all?""  ""All what?"" asked Harry.  ""ALL WHAT?"" Hagrid thundered. ""Now wait jus' one second!""  He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against the wall.  ""Do you mean ter tell me,"" he growled at the Dursleys, ""that this boy -- this boy! -- knows nothin' abou' -- about ANYTHING?""  Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren't bad.  ""I know some things,"" he said. ""I can, you know, do math and stuff.""  But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, ""About our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents' world.""  ""What world?""  Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode.  ""DURSLEY!"" he boomed.  Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like ""Mimblewimble."" Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.  ""But yeh must know about yer mom and dad,"" he said. ""I mean, they're famous. You're famous.""  ""What? My -- my mom and dad weren't famous, were they?""  ""Yeh don' know... yeh don' know... "" Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.  ""Yeh don' know what yeh are ?"" he said finally.  Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.  ""Stop!"" he commanded. ""Stop right there, sir! I forbid you to tell the boy anything!""  A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage.  ""You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An' you've kept it from him all these years?""  ""Kept what from me?"" said Harry eagerly.  ""STOP! I FORBID YOU!"" yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.  Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.  ""Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,"" said Hagrid. ""Harry -- yer a wizard.""  There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard.  ""I'm a what ?"" gasped Harry.  ""A wizard, o' course,"" said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, ""an' a thumpin' good 'un, I'd say, once yeh've been trained up a bit. With a mum an' dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An' I reckon it's abou' time yeh read yer letter.""  Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read:  HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY  Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE  (Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)  Dear Mr. Potter,  We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.  Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31.  Yours sincerely,  Minerva McGonagall,  Deputy Headmistress  Questions exploded inside Harry's head like fireworks and he couldn't decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, ""What does it mean, they await my owl?""  ""Gallopin' Gorgons, that reminds me,"" said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl -- a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl -- a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down:  Dear Professor Dumbledore,  Given Harry his letter.  Taking him to buy his things tomorrow.  Weather's horrible. Hope you're well.  Hagrid  Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone.  Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.  ""Where was I?"" said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.  ""He's not going,"" he said.  Hagrid grunted.  ""I'd like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,"" he said.  ""A what?"" said Harry, interested.  ""A Muggle,"" said Hagrid, ""it's what we call nonmagic folk like them. An' it's your bad luck you grew up in a family o' the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.""  ""We swore when we took him in we'd put a stop to that rubbish,"" said Uncle Vernon, ""swore we'd stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!""  ""You knew ?"" said Harry. ""You knew I'm a -- a wizard?""  ""Knew!"" shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. ""Knew! Of course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that -- that school -- and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was -- a freak! But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family!""  She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years.  ""Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just as -- as -- abnormal -- and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!""  Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, ""Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash!""  ""CAR CRASH!"" roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. ""How could a car crash kill Lily an' James Potter? It's an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin' his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!""  ""But why? What happened?"" Harry asked urgently.  The anger faded from Hagrid's face. He looked suddenly anxious.  ""I never expected this,"" he said, in a low, worried voice. ""I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin' hold of yeh, how much yeh didn't know. Ah, Harry, I don' know if I'm the right person ter tell yeh -- but someone's gotta -- yeh can't go off ter Hogwarts not knowin'.""  He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.  ""Well, it's best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh -- mind, I can't tell yeh everythin', it's a great myst'ry, parts of it...""  He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, ""It begins, I suppose, with -- with a person called -- but it's incredible yeh don't know his name, everyone in our world knows--""  ""Who?""  ""Well -- I don' like sayin' the name if I can help it. No one does.""  ""Why not?""  ""Gulpin' gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went... bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was...""  Hagrid gulped, but no words came out.  ""Could you write it down?"" Harry suggested.  ""Nah -- can't spell it. All right -- Voldemort."" Hagrid shuddered. ""Don' make me say it again. Anyway, this -- this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin' fer followers. Got 'em, too -- some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o' his power, 'cause he was gettin' himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn't know who ter trust, didn't dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches... terrible things happened. He was takin' over. 'Course, some stood up to him -- an' he killed 'em. Horribly. One o' the only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore's the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn't dare try takin' the school, not jus' then, anyway.  ""Now, yer mum an' dad were as good a witch an' wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an' girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst'ry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get 'em on his side before... probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin' ter do with the Dark Side.  ""Maybe he thought he could persuade 'em... maybe he just wanted 'em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer house an' -- an'--""  Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn.  ""Sorry,"" he said. ""But it's that sad -- knew yer mum an' dad, an' nicer people yeh couldn't find -- anyway...  ""You-Know-Who killed 'em. An' then -- an' this is the real myst'ry of the thing -- he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin' by then. But he couldn't do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That's what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh -- took care of yer mum an' dad an' yer house, even -- but it didn't work on you, an' that's why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill 'em, no one except you, an' he'd killed some o' the best witches an' wizards of the age -- the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts -- an' you was only a baby, an' you lived.""  Something very painful was going on in Harry's mind. As Hagrid's story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before -- and he remembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh.  Hagrid was watching him sadly.  ""Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore's orders. Brought yeh ter this lot...""  ""Load of old tosh,"" said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched.  ""Now, you listen here, boy,"" he snarled, ""I accept there's something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn't have cured -- and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdoes, no denying it, and the world's better off without them in my opinion -- asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types -- just what I expected, always knew they'd come to a sticky end--""  But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, ""I'm warning you, Dursley -- I'm warning you -- one more word...""  In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon's courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent.  ""That's better,"" said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.  Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them.  ""But what happened to Vol-, sorry -- I mean, You-Know-Who?""  ""Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That's the biggest myst'ry, see... he was gettin' more an' more powerful -- why'd he go?  ""Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he's still out there, bidin' his time, like, but I don' believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of 'em came outta kinda trances. Don' reckon they could've done if he was comin' back.  ""Most of us reckon he's still out there somewhere but lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. 'Cause somethin' about you finished him, Harry. There was somethin' goin' on that night he hadn't counted on -- I dunno what it was, no one does -- but somethin' about you stumped him, all right.""  Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He'd spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn't they been turned into warty toads every time they'd tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he'd once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football?  ""Hagrid,"" he said quietly, ""I think you must have made a mistake. I don't think I can be a wizard.""  To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.  ""Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or angry?""  Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it... every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry... chased by Dudley's gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach... dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he'd managed to make it grow back... and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn't he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn't he set a boa constrictor on him?  Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him.  ""See?"" said Hagrid. ""Harry Potter, not a wizard -- you wait, you'll be right famous at Hogwarts.""  But Uncle Vernon wasn't going to give in without a fight.  ""Haven't I told you he's not going?"" he hissed. ""He's going to Stonewall High and he'll be grateful for it. I've read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish -- spell books and wands and--""  ""If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won't stop him,"" growled Hagrid. ""Stop Lily an' James Potter's son goin' ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name's been down ever since he was born. He's off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won't know himself. He'll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an' he'll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had Albus Dumbled--""  ""I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!"" yelled Uncle Vernon.  But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head, ""NEVER -- "" he thundered, "" -- INSULT -- ALBUS -- DUMBLEDORE -- IN -- FRONT -- OF -- ME!""  He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley -- there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig's tail poking through a hole in his trousers.  Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them.  Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard.  ""Shouldn'ta lost me temper,"" he said ruefully, ""but it didn't work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn't much left ter do.""  He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows.  ""Be grateful if yeh didn't mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,"" he said. ""I'm -- er -- not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin'. I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an' get yer letters to yeh an' stuff -- one o' the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job.""  ""Why aren't you supposed to do magic?"" asked Harry.  ""Oh, well -- I was at Hogwarts meself but I -- er -- got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an' everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore.""  ""Why were you expelled?""  ""It's gettin' late and we've got lots ter do tomorrow,"" said Hagrid loudly. ""Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an' that.""  He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry.  ""You can kip under that,"" he said. ""Don' mind if it wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o' doormice in one o' the pockets."""
Harry Potter 1 Chapter 7,"The door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry's first thought was that this was not someone to cross.  ""The firs' years, Professor McGonagall,"" said Hagrid.  ""Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.""  She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys' house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors.  They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right -- the rest of the school must already be here -- but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously.  ""Welcome to Hogwarts,"" said Professor McGonagall. ""The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room.  ""The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.  ""The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.""  Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville's cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron's smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair.  ""I shall return when we are ready for you,"" said Professor McGonagall. ""Please wait quietly.""  She left the chamber. Harry swallowed.  ""How exactly do they sort us into houses?"" he asked Ron.  ""Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.""  Harry's heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school? But he didn't know any magic yet -- what on earth would he have to do? He hadn't expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she'd learned and wondering which one she'd need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He'd never been more nervous, never, not even when he'd had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he'd somehow turned his teacher's wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom.  Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air -- several people behind him screamed.  ""What the -- ?""  He gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: ""Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance--""  ""My dear Friar, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he's not really even a ghost -- I say, what are you all doing here?""  A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.  Nobody answered.  ""New students!"" said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. ""About to be Sorted, I suppose?""  A few people nodded mutely.  ""Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!"" said the Friar. ""My old house, you know.""  ""Move along now,"" said a sharp voice. ""The Sorting Ceremony's about to start.""  Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall.  ""Now, form a line,"" Professor McGonagall told the first years, ""and follow me.""  Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.  Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, ""Its bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.""  It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn't simply open on to the heavens.  Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard's hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn't have let it in the house.  Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing -- noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth -- and the hat began to sing:  ""Oh, you may not think I'm pretty,  But don't judge on what you see,  I'll eat myself if you can find  A smarter hat than me.  You can keep your bowlers black,  Your top hats sleek and tall,  For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat  And I can cap them all.  There's nothing hidden in your head  The Sorting Hat can't see,  So try me on and I will tell you  Where you ought to be.  You might belong in Gryffindor,  Where dwell the brave at heart,  Their daring, nerve, and chivalry  Set Gryffindors apart;  You might belong in Hufflepuff,  Where they are just and loyal,  Those patient Hufflepuffs are true  And unafraid of toil;  Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, if you've a ready mind,  Where those of wit and learning,  Will always find their kind;  Or perhaps in Slytherin  You'll make your real friends,  Those cunning folk use any means  To achieve their ends.  So put me on! Don't be afraid!  And don't get in a flap!  You're in safe hands (though I have none)  For I'm a Thinking Cap!""  The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.  ""So we've just got to try on the hat!"" Ron whispered to Harry. ""I'll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.""  Harry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn't feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.  Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.  ""When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,"" she said. ""Abbott, Hannah!""  A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause --  ""HUFFLEPUFF!"" shouted the hat.  The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her.  ""Bones, Susan!""  ""HUFFLEPUFF!"" shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah.  ""Boot, Terry!""  ""RAVENCLAW!""  The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.  ""Brocklehurst, Mandy"" went to Ravenclaw too, but ""Brown, Lavender"" became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron's twin brothers catcalling.  ""Bulstrode, Millicent"" then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry's imagination, after all he'd heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot.  He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.  ""Finch-Fletchley, Justin!""  ""HUFFLEPUFF!""  Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. ""Finnigan, Seamus,"" the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.  ""Granger, Hermione!""  Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.  ""GRYFFINDOR!"" shouted the hat. Ron groaned.  A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you're very nervous. What if he wasn't chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he'd better get back on the train?  When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, ""GRYFFINDOR,"" Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to ""MacDougal, Morag.""  Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, ""SLYTHERIN!""  Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself.  There weren't many people left now. ""Moon""..., ""Nott""..., ""Parkinson""..., then a pair of twin girls, ""Patil"" and ""Patil""..., then ""Perks, Sally-Anne""..., and then, at last --  ""Potter, Harry!""  As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.  ""Potter, did she say?""  ""The Harry Potter?""  The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.  ""Hmm,"" said a small voice in his ear. ""Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There's talent, A my goodness, yes -- and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting... So where shall I put you?""  Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.  ""Not Slytherin, eh?"" said the small voice. ""Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that -- no? Well, if you're sure -- better be GRYFFINDOR!""  Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, ""We got Potter! We got Potter!"" Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he'd seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he'd just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.  He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he'd gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore's silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.  And now there were only three people left to be sorted. ""Thomas, Dean,"" a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. ""Turpin, Lisa,"" became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron's turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, ""GRYFFINDOR!""  Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him.  ""Well done, Ron, excellent,"" said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as ""Zabini, Blaise,"" was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.  Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.  Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.  ""Welcome,"" he said. ""Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!  ""Thank you!""  He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn't know whether to laugh or not.  ""Is he -- a bit mad?"" he asked Percy uncertainly.  ""Mad?"" said Percy airily. ""He's a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?""  Harry's mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.  The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious.  ""That does look good,"" said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak.  ""Can't you -- ?""  ""I haven't eaten for nearly five hundred years,"" said the ghost. ""I don't need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don't think I've introduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.""  ""I know who you are!"" said Ron suddenly. ""My brothers told me about you -- you're Nearly Headless Nick!""  ""I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy -- "" the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.  ""Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?""  Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn't going at all the way he wanted.  ""Like this,"" he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, ""So -- new Gryffindors! I hope you're going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron's becoming almost unbearable -- he's the Slytherin ghost.""  Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn't look too pleased with the seating arrangements.  ""How did he get covered in blood?"" asked Seamus with great interest.  ""I've never asked,"" said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.  When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding...  As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.  ""I'm half-and-half,"" said Seamus. ""Me dad's a Muggle. Mom didn't tell him she was a witch 'til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.""  The others laughed.  ""What about you, Neville?"" said Ron.  ""Well, my gran brought me up and she's a witch,"" said Neville, ""but the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me -- he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned -- but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here -- they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.""  On Harry's other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (""I do hope they start right away, there's so much to learn, I'm particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it's supposed to be very difficult -- ""; ""You'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing -- "").  Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.  It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell's turban straight into Harry's eyes -- and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry's forehead.  ""Ouch!"" Harry clapped a hand to his head.  ""What is it?"" asked Percy.  ""N-nothing.""  The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher's look -- a feeling that he didn't like Harry at all.  ""Who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?"" he asked Percy.  ""Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he's looking so nervous, that's Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn't want to -- everyone knows he's after Quirrell's job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.""  Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn't look at him again.  At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.  ""Ahem -- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.  ""First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.""  Dumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.  ""I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.  ""Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.  ""And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.""  Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.  ""He's not serious?"" he muttered to Percy.  ""Must be,"" said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. ""It's odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we're not allowed to go somewhere -- the forest's full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.""  ""And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!"" cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers' smiles had become rather fixed.  Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.  ""Everyone pick their favorite tune,"" said Dumbledore, ""and off we go!""  And the school bellowed:  ""Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,  Teach us something please,  Whether we be old and bald  Or young with scabby knees,  Our heads could do with filling  With some interesting stuff,  For now they're bare and full of air,  Dead flies and bits of fluff,  So teach us things worth knowing,  Bring back what we've forgot, just do your best, we'll do the rest,  And learn until our brains all rot.""  Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.  ""Ah, music,"" he said, wiping his eyes. ""A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!""  The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry's legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.  A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.  ""Peeves,"" Percy whispered to the first years. ""A poltergeist."" He raised his voice, ""Peeves -- show yourself.""  A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.  ""Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?""  There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.  ""Oooooooh!"" he said, with an evil cackle. ""Ickle Firsties! What fun!""  He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.  ""Go away, Peeves, or the Baron'll hear about this, I mean it!"" barked Percy.  Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville's head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.  ""You want to watch out for Peeves,"" said Percy, as they set off again. ""The Bloody Baron's the only one who can control him, he won't even listen to us prefects. Here we are.""  At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.  ""Password?"" she said.  ""Caput Draconis,"" said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it -- Neville needed a leg up -- and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.  Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase -- they were obviously in one of the towers -- they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.  ""Great food, isn't it?"" Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. ""Get off, Scabbers! He's chewing my sheets.""  Harry was going to ask Ron if he'd had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.  Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell's turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn't want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully -- and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it -- then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold -- there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.  He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn't remember the dream at all."
Harry Potter 1 Chapter 8,"There, look.  ""Where?""  ""Next to the tall kid with the red hair.""  ""Wearing the glasses?""  ""Did you see his face?""  ""Did you see his scar?""  Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they wouldn't, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.  There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn't open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren't really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.  The ghosts didn't help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, ""GOT YOUR CONK!""  Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He wouldn't believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.  Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch's. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she'd whisk off for Filch, who'd appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.  And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.  They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for. Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.  Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry's name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.  Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to think she wasn't a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class.  ""Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,"" she said. ""Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.""  Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldn't wait to get started, but soon realized they weren't going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.  The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell's lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he'd met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren't sure they believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.  Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn't miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn't had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn't have much of a head start.  Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.  ""What have we got today?"" Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge.  ""Double Potions with the Slytherins,"" said Ron. ""Snape's Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them -- we'll be able to see if it's true.""  ""Wish McGonagall favored us,"" said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn't stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.  Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.  Hedwig hadn't brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry's plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl:  Dear Harry,  I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three?  I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig.  Hagrid  Harry borrowed Ron's quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.  It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far.  At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he'd been wrong. Snape didn't dislike Harry -- he hated him.  Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.  Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry's name.  ""Ah, Yes,"" he said softly, ""Harry Potter. Our new -- celebrity.""  Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had none of Hagrid's warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.  ""You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking,"" he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. ""As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death -- if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.""  More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn't a dunderhead.  ""Potter!"" said Snape suddenly. ""What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?""  Powdered root of what to an infusion of what ? Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione's hand had shot into the air.  ""I don't know, sir,"" said Harry.  Snape's lips curled into a sneer.  ""Tut, tut -- fame clearly isn't everything.""  He ignored Hermione's hand.  ""Let's try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?""  Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn't have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter.  ""I don't know, sir.""  ""Thought you wouldn't open a book before coming, eh, Potter?"" Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys', but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi ?  Snape was still ignoring Hermione's quivering hand.  ""What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?""  At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.  ""I don't know,"" said Harry quietly. ""I think Hermione does, though, why don't you try her?""  A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus's eye, and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased.  ""Sit down,"" he snapped at Hermione. ""For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren't you all copying that down?""  There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, ""And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.""  Things didn't improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus's cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people's shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.  ""Idiot boy!"" snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. ""I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?""  Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.  ""Take him up to the hospital wing,"" Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.  ""You -- Potter -- why didn't you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he'd make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That's another point you've lost for Gryffindor.""  This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron.  ""Don't push it,"" he muttered, ""I've heard Snape can turn very nasty.""  As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry's mind was racing and his spirits were low. He'd lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week -- why did Snape hate him so much?  ""Cheer up,"" said Ron, ""Snape's always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?""  At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.  When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid's voice rang out, saying, ""Back, Fang -- back.""  Hagrid's big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open.  ""Hang on,"" he said. ""Back, Fang.""  He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.  There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.  ""Make yerselves at home,"" said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.  ""This is Ron,"" Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.  ""Another Weasley, eh?"" said Hagrid, glancing at Ron's freckles. I spent half me life chasin' yer twin brothers away from the forest.""  The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry's knee and drooled all over his robes.  Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch ""that old git.""  ""An' as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I'd like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D'yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can't get rid of her -- Filch puts her up to it.""  Harry told Hagrid about Snape's lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.  ""But he seemed to really hate me.""  ""Rubbish!"" said Hagrid. ""Why should he?""  Yet Harry couldn't help thinking that Hagrid didn't quite meet his eyes when he said that.  ""How's yer brother Charlie?"" Hagrid asked Ron. ""I liked him a lot -- great with animals.""  Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie's work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet :  GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST  Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.  Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.  ""But we're not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what's good for you,"" said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.  Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn't mentioned the date.  ""Hagrid!"" said Harry, ""that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday! It might've been happening while we were there!""  There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn't meet Harry's eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for?  As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they'd been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he'd had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn't want to tell Harry?"
Harry Potter 1 Chapter 9,"Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn't have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn't until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday -- and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.  ""Typical,"" said Harry darkly. ""Just what I always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.""  He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.  ""You don't know that you'll make a fool of yourself,"" said Ron reasonably. ""Anyway, I know Malfoy's always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that's all talk.""  Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn't the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he'd spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who'd listen about the time he'd almost hit a hang glider on Charlie's old broom. Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn't see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean's poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move.  Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she'd had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.  Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. This was something you couldn't learn by heart out of a book -- not that she hadn't tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she'd gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione's lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.  Harry hadn't had a single letter since Hagrid's note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy's eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table.  A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.  ""It's a Remembrall!"" he explained. ""Gran knows I forget things -- this tells you if there's something you've forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red -- oh... "" His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, ""... you've forgotten something...""  Neville was trying to remember what he'd forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand.  Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.  ""What's going on?""  ""Malfoy's got my Remembrall, Professor.""  Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.  ""Just looking,"" he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him.  At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.  The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.  Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk.  ""Well, what are you all waiting for?"" she barked. ""Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.""  Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles.  ""Stick out your right hand over your broom,"" called Madam Hooch at the front, ""and say 'Up!'""  ""UP"" everyone shouted.  Harry's broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger's had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville's hadn't moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville's voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.  Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he'd been doing it wrong for years.  ""Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,"" said Madam Hooch. ""Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle -- three -- two--""  But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch's lips.  ""Come back, boy!"" she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle -- twelve feet -- twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and --  WHAM -- a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.  Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.  ""Broken wrist,"" Harry heard her mutter. ""Come on, boy -- it's all right, up you get.""  She turned to the rest of the class.  ""None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you'll be out of Hogwarts before you can say 'Quidditch.' Come on, dear.""  Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.  No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.  ""Did you see his face, the great lump?""  The other Slytherins joined in.  ""Shut up, Malfoy,"" snapped Parvati Patil.  ""Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?"" said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. ""Never thought you'd like fat little crybabies, Parvati.""  ""Look!"" said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. ""It's that stupid thing Longbottom's gran sent him.""  The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.  ""Give that here, Malfoy,"" said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to watch.  Malfoy smiled nastily.  ""I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find -- how about -- up a tree?""  ""Give it here!"" Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off. He hadn't been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, ""Come and get it, Potter!""  Harry grabbed his broom.  ""No!"" shouted Hermione Granger. ""Madam Hooch told us not to move -- you'll get us all into trouble.""  Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him -- and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he'd found something he could do without being taught -- this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.  He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked stunned.  ""Give it here,"" Harry called, ""or I'll knock you off that broom!""  ""Oh, yeah?"" said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.  Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfoy like a javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping.  ""No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,"" Harry called.  The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.  ""Catch it if you can, then!"" he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.  Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down -- next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball -- wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching -- he stretched out his hand -- a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.  ""HARRY POTTER!""  His heart sank faster than he'd just dived. Professor McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling.  ""Never -- in all my time at Hogwarts--""  Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, "" -- how dare you -- might have broken your neck--""  ""It wasn't his fault, Professor--""  ""Be quiet, Miss Patil--""  ""But Malfoy--""  ""That's enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.""  Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle's triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall's wake as she strode toward the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he'd done it. He hadn't even lasted two weeks. He'd be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep?  Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn't say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid's assistant. His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid's bag.  Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door and poked her head inside.  ""Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?""  Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him?  But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out of Flitwick's class looking confused.  ""Follow me, you two,"" said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.  ""In here.""  Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.  ""Out, Peeves!"" she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys.  ""Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood -- I've found you a Seeker.""  Wood's expression changed from puzzlement to delight.  ""Are you serious, Professor?""  ""Absolutely,"" said Professor McGonagall crisply. ""The boy's a natural. I've never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?""  Harry nodded silently. He didn't have a clue what was going on, but he didn't seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs.  ""He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,"" Professor McGonagall told Wood. ""Didn't even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn't have done it.""  Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once.  ""Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?"" he asked excitedly.  ""Wood's captain of the Gryffindor team,"" Professor McGonagall explained.  ""He's just the build for a Seeker, too,"" said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him. ""Light -- speedy -- we'll have to get him a decent broom, Professor -- a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I'd say.""  ""I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can't bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn't look Severus Snape in the face for weeks...""  Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.  ""I want to hear you're training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.""  Then she suddenly smiled.  ""Your father would have been proud,"" she said. ""He was an excellent Quidditch player himself.""  ""You're joking.""  It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he'd left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he'd forgotten all about it.  ""Seeker ?"" he said. ""But first years never -- you must be the youngest house player in about--""  ""-- a century,"" said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. ""Wood told me.""  Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.  ""I start training next week,"" said Harry. ""Only don't tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.""  Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over.  ""Well done,"" said George in a low voice. ""Wood told us. We're on the team too -- Beaters.""  ""I tell you, we're going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,"" said Fred. ""We haven't won since Charlie left, but this year's team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.""  ""Anyway, we've got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he's found a new secret passageway out of the school.""  ""Bet it's that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you.""  Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.  ""Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?""  ""You're a lot braver now that you're back on the ground and you've got your little friends with you,"" said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl.  ""I'd take you on anytime on my own,"" said Malfoy. ""Tonight, if you want. Wizard's duel. Wands only -- no contact. What's the matter? Never heard of a wizard's duel before, I suppose?""  ""Of course he has,"" said Ron, wheeling around. ""I'm his second, who's yours?""  Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.  ""Crabbe,"" he said. ""Midnight all right? We'll meet you in the trophy room; that's always unlocked.""  When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.  ""What is a wizard's duel?"" said Harry. ""And what do you mean, you're my second?""  ""Well, a second's there to take over if you die,"" said Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry's face, he added quickly, ""But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy'll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.""  ""And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?""  ""Throw it away and punch him on the nose,"" Ron suggested.  ""Excuse me.""  They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.  ""Can't a person eat in peace in this place?"" said Ron.  Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.  ""I couldn't help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying--""  ""Bet you could,"" Ron muttered.  ""-- and you mustn't go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you'll lose Gryffindor if you're caught, and you're bound to be. It's really very selfish of you.""  ""And it's really none of your business,"" said Harry.  ""Good-bye,"" said Ron.  All the same, it wasn't what you'd call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn't back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as ""If he tries to curse you, you'd better dodge it, because I can't remember how to block them."" There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoy's sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness -- this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face. He couldn't miss it.  ""Half-past eleven,"" Ron muttered at last, ""we'd better go.""  They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, ""I can't believe you're going to do this, Harry.""  A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown.  ""You!"" said Ron furiously. ""Go back to bed!""  ""I almost told your brother,"" Hermione snapped, ""Percy -- he's a prefect, he'd put a stop to this.""  Harry couldn't believe anyone could be so interfering.  ""Come on,"" he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole.  Hermione wasn't going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.  ""Don't you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I don't want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you'll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.""  ""Go away.""  ""All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you're on the train home tomorrow, you're so--""  But what they were, they didn't find out. Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor tower.  ""Now what am I going to do?"" she asked shrilly.  ""That's your problem,"" said Ron. ""We've got to go, we're going to be late.""  They hadn't even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them.  ""I'm coming with you,"" she said.  ""You are not.""  ""D'you think I'm going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I'll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up.""  ""You've got some nerve -- "" said Ron loudly.  ""Shut up, both of you!"" said Harry sharply. I heard something.""  It was a sort of snuffling.  ""Mrs. Norris?"" breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.  It wasn't Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.  ""Thank goodness you found me! I've been out here for hours, I couldn't remember the new password to get in to bed.""  ""Keep your voice down, Neville. The password's 'Pig snout' but it won't help you now, the Fat Lady's gone off somewhere.""  ""How's your arm?"" said Harry.  ""Fine,"" said Neville, showing them. ""Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.""  ""Good -- well, look, Neville, we've got to be somewhere, we'll see you later--""  ""Don't leave me!"" said Neville, scrambling to his feet, ""I don't want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron's been past twice already.""  Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville.  ""If either of you get us caught, I'll never rest until I've learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.""  Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.  They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room.  Malfoy and Crabbe weren't there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by.  ""He's late, maybe he's chickened out,"" Ron whispered.  Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak -- and it wasn't Malfoy.  ""Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.""  It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch's voice. Neville's robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room.  ""They're in here somewhere,"" they heard him mutter, ""probably hiding.""  ""This way!"" Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor.  The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.  ""RUN!"" Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following -- they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going -- they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.  ""I think we've lost him,"" Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering.  ""I -- told -- you,"" Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, ""I -- told -- you.""  ""We've got to get back to Gryffindor tower,"" said Ron, ""quickly as possible.""  ""Malfoy tricked you,"" Hermione said to Harry. ""You realize that, don't you? He was never going to meet you -- Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.""  Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn't going to tell her that.  ""Let's go.""  It wasn't going to be that simple. They hadn't gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them.  It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.  ""Shut up, Peeves -- please -- you'll get us thrown out.""  Peeves cackled.  ""Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you'll get caughty.""  ""Not if you don't give us away, Peeves, please.""  ""Should tell Filch, I should,"" said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. ""It's for your own good, you know.""  ""Get out of the way,"" snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a big mistake.  ""STUDENTS OUT OF BED!"" Peeves bellowed, ""STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!""  Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door -- and it was locked.  ""This is it!"" Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, ""We're done for! This is the end!""  They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves's shouts.  ""Oh, move over,"" Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry's wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, ""Alohomora!""  The lock clicked and the door swung open -- they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.  ""Which way did they go, Peeves?"" Filch was saying. ""Quick, tell me.""  ""Say 'please.'""  ""Don't mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go ?""  ""Shan't say nothing if you don't say please,"" said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice.  ""All right -- please.""  ""NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn't say nothing if you didn't say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!"" And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage.  ""He thinks this door is locked,"" Harry whispered. ""I think we'll be okay -- get off, Neville!"" For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry's bathrobe for the last minute. ""What ?""  Harry turned around -- and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was sure he'd walked into a nightmare -- this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far.  They weren't in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden.  They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.  It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren't already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.  Harry groped for the doorknob -- between Filch and death, he'd take Filch.  They fell backward -- Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn't see him anywhere, but they hardly cared -- all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn't stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.  ""Where on earth have you all been?"" she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.  ""Never mind that -- pig snout, pig snout,"" panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.  It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he'd never speak again.  ""What do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?"" said Ron finally. ""If any dog needs exercise, that one does.""  Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. ""You don't use your eyes, any of you, do you?"" she snapped. ""Didn't you see what it was standing on.  ""The floor?"" Harry suggested. ""I wasn't looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.""  ""No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It's obviously guarding something.""  She stood up, glaring at them.  ""I hope you're pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed -- or worse, expelled. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to bed.""  Ron stared after her, his mouth open.  ""No, we don't mind,"" he said. ""You'd think we dragged her along, wouldn't you.  But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something... What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide -- except perhaps Hogwarts.  It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was."
Harry Potter 1 Chapter 10,"Malfoy couldn't believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.  ""It's either really valuable or really dangerous,"" said Ron.  ""Or both,"" said Harry.  But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn't have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.  Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again.  Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.  As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone's attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.  Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:  DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.  It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don't want everybody knowing you've got a broomstick or they'll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o'clock for your first training session.  Professor McGonagall  Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read.  ""A Nimbus Two Thousand!"" Ron moaned enviously. ""I've never even touched one.""  They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it.  ""That's a broomstick,"" he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. ""You'll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren't allowed them.""  Ron couldn't resist it.  ""It's not any old broomstick,"" he said, ""it's a Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you say you've got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?"" Ron grinned at Harry. ""Comets look flashy, but they're not in the same league as the Nimbus.""  ""What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn't afford half the handle,"" Malfoy snapped back. ""I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.""  Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy's elbow.  ""Not arguing, I hope, boys?"" he squeaked.  ""Potter's been sent a broomstick, Professor,"" said Malfoy quickly.  ""Yes, yes, that's right,"" said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry. ""Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter. And what model is it?""  ""A Nimbus Two Thousand, it is,"" said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy's face. ""And it's really thanks to Malfoy here that I've got it,"" he added.  Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy's obvious rage and confusion.  ""Well, it's true,"" Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, ""If he hadn't stolen Neville's Remembrall I wouldn't be on the team...""  ""So I suppose you think that's a reward for breaking rules?"" came an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry's hand.  ""I thought you weren't speaking to us?"" said Harry.  ""Yes, don't stop now,"" said Ron, ""it's doing us so much good.""  Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.  Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he'd be learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.  ""Wow,"" Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry's bedspread.  Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top.  As seven o'clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.  Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling -- he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.  ""Hey, Potter, come down!""  Oliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to him.  ""Very nice,"" said Wood, his eyes glinting. ""I see what McGonagall meant... you really are a natural. I'm just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you'll be joining team practice three times a week.""  He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.  ""Right,"" said Wood. ""Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it's not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of them are called Chasers.""  ""Three Chasers,"" Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.  ""This ball's called the Quaffle,"" said Wood. ""The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?""  ""The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,"" Harry recited. ""So -- that's sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn't it?""  ""What's basketball?"" said Wood curiously.  ""Never mind,"" said Harry quickly.  ""Now, there's another player on each side who's called the Keeper -- I'm Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring.""  ""Three Chasers, one Keeper,"" said Harry, who was determined to remember it all. ""And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?"" He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.  ""I'll show you now,"" said Wood. ""Take this.""  He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.  ""I'm going to show you what the Bludgers do,"" Wood said. ""These two are the Bludgers.""  He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box.  ""Stand back,"" Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers.  At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry's face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air -- it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.  ""See?"" Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely. ""The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms. That's why you have two Beaters on each team -- the Weasley twins are ours -- it's their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So -- think you've got all that?""  ""Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,"" Harry reeled off.  ""Very good,"" said Wood.  ""Er -- have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?"" Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand.  ""Never at Hogwarts. We've had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. That's you. And you don't have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers--""  ""-- unless they crack my head open.""  ""Don't worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers -- I mean, they're like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.""  Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings.  ""This,"" said Wood, ""is the Golden Snitch, and it's the most important ball of the lot. It's very hard to catch because it's so fast and difficult to see. It's the Seeker's job to catch it. You've got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team's Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. That's why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages -- I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep.  ""Well, that's it, any questions?""  Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem.  ""We won't practice with the Snitch yet,"" said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, ""it's too dark, we might lose it. Let's try you out with a few of these.""  He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.  Harry didn't miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn't carry on.  ""That Quidditch Cup'll have our name on it this year,"" said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. ""I wouldn't be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn't gone off chasing dragons.""  Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he'd already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.  On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they'd seen him make Neville's toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry's partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn't spoken to either of them since the day Harry's broomstick had arrived.  ""Now, don't forget that nice wrist movement we've been practicing!"" squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual. ""Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is very important, too -- never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.""  It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it -- Harry had to put it out with his hat.  Ron, at the next table, wasn't having much more luck.  ""Wingardium Leviosa!"" he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.  ""You're saying it wrong,"" Harry heard Hermione snap. ""It's Wing- gar -dium Levi- o -sa, make the 'gar' nice and long.""  ""You do it, then, if you're so clever,"" Ron snarled.  Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, ""Wingardium Leviosa!""  Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads.  ""Oh, well done!"" cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. ""Everyone see here, Miss Granger's done it!""  Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.  ""It's no wonder no one can stand her,"" he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, ""she's a nightmare, honestly.""  Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face -- and was startled to see that she was in tears.  ""I think she heard you.""  ""So?"" said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. ""She must've noticed she's got no friends.""  Hermione didn't turn up for the next class and wasn't seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls' bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds.  A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet.  Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore's chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, ""Troll -- in the dungeons -- thought you ought to know.""  He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.  There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore's wand to bring silence.  ""Prefects,"" he rumbled, ""lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!""  Percy was in his element.  ""Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming through! Excuse me, I'm a prefect!""  ""How could a troll get in?"" Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.  ""Don't ask me, they're supposed to be really stupid,"" said Ron. ""Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke.""  They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron's arm.  ""I've just thought -- Hermione.""  ""What about her?""  ""She doesn't know about the troll.""  Ron bit his lip.  ""Oh, all right,"" he snapped. ""But Percy'd better not see us.""  Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls' bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them.  ""Percy!"" hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.  Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view.  ""What's he doing?"" Harry whispered. ""Why isn't he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?""  ""Search me.""  Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape's fading footsteps.  ""He's heading for the third floor,"" Harry said, but Ron held up his hand.  ""Can you smell something?""  Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.  And then they heard it -- a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed -- at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.  It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.  The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.  ""The keys in the lock,"" Harry muttered. ""We could lock it in.""  ""Good idea,"" said Ron nervously.  They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn't about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it.  ""Yes!""  Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop -- a high, petrified scream -- and it was coming from the chamber they'd just chained up.  ""Oh, no,"" said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.  ""It's the girls' bathroom!"" Harry gasped.  ""Hermione!"" they said together.  It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.  Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went.  ""Confuse it!"" Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall.  The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went.  ""Oy, pea-brain!"" yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn't even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.  ""Come on, run, run!"" Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn't move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror.  The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.  Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll's neck from behind. The troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry's wand had still been in his hand when he'd jumped - it had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils.  Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club.  Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand -- not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: ""Wingardium Leviosa!""  The club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over -- and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner's head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.  Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.  It was Hermione who spoke first.  ""Is it -- dead?""  ""I don't think so,"" said Harry, I think it's just been knocked out.""  He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll's nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.  ""Urgh -- troll boogers.""  He wiped it on the troll's trousers.  A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up. They hadn't realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll's roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.  Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry's mind.  ""What on earth were you thinking of?"" said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air. ""You're lucky you weren't killed. Why aren't you in your dormitory?""  Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down.  Then a small voice came out of the shadows.  ""Please, Professor McGonagall -- they were looking for me.""  ""Miss Granger!""  Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last.  ""I went looking for the troll because I -- I thought I could deal with it on my own -- you know, because I've read all about them.""  Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher?  ""If they hadn't found me, I'd be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn't have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.""  Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn't new to them.  ""Well -- in that case... "" said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of them, ""Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?""  Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets.  ""Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,"" said Professor McGonagall. ""I'm very disappointed in you. If you're not hurt at all, you'd better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing the feast in their houses.""  Hermione left.  Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.  ""Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.""  They hurried out of the chamber and didn't speak at all until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else.  ""We should have gotten more than ten points,"" Ron grumbled.  ""Five, you mean, once she's taken off Hermione's.""  ""Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,"" Ron admitted. ""Mind you, we did save her.""  ""She might not have needed saving if we hadn't locked the thing in with her,"" Harry reminded him.  They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.  ""Pig snout,"" they said and entered.  The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said ""Thanks,"" and hurried off to get plates.  But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them."
Harry Potter 1 Chapter 11,"As they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.  The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house championship.  Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn't know which was worse -- people telling him he'd be brilliant or people telling him they'd be running around underneath him holding a mattress.  It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend. He didn't know how he'd have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read.  Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.  Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it. The day before Harry's first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn't be allowed. Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces caught Snape's eye. He limped over. He hadn't seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway.  ""What's that you've got there, Potter?""  It was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him.  ""Library books are not to be taken outside the school,"" said Snape. ""Give it to me. Five points from Gryffindor.""  ""He's just made that rule up,"" Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away. ""Wonder what's wrong with his leg?""  ""Dunno, but I hope it's really hurting him,"" said Ron bitterly.  The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and Ron's Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy (""How will you learn?""), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right answers anyway.  Harry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it.  ""Better you than me,"" they said together, but Harry had an idea that Snape wouldn't refuse if there were other teachers listening.  He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no answer. He knocked again. Nothing.  Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He pushed the door ajar and peered inside - and a horrible scene met his eyes.  Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape bandages.  ""Blasted thing,"" Snape was saying. ""How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?""  Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but --  ""POTTER!""  Snape's face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg. Harry gulped.  ""I just wondered if I could have my book back.""  ""GET OUT! OUT!""  Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor. He sprinted back upstairs.  ""Did you get it?"" Ron asked as Harry joined them. ""What's the matter?""  In a low whisper, Harry told them what he'd seen.  ""You know what this means?"" he finished breathlessly. ""He tried to get past that three-headed dog at Halloween! That's where he was going when we saw him -- he's after whatever it's guarding! And I'd bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!""  Hermione's eyes were wide.  ""No -- he wouldn't, she said. ""I know he's not very nice, but he wouldn't try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.""  ""Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,"" snapped Ron. ""I'm with Harry. I wouldn't put anything past Snape. But what's he after? What's that dog guarding?""  Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question. Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn't sleep. He tried to empty his mind -- he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours - but the expression on Snape's face when Harry had seen his leg wasn't easy to forget.  The next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match.  ""You've got to eat some breakfast.""  ""I don't want anything.""  ""Just a bit of toast,"" wheedled Hermione.  ""I'm not hungry.""  Harry felt terrible. In an hour's time he'd be walking onto the field.  ""Harry, you need your strength,"" said Seamus Finnigan. ""Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team.""  ""Thanks, Seamus,"" said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his sausages.  By eleven o'clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes.  Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors.  Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green).  Wood cleared his throat for silence.  ""Okay, men,"" he said.  ""And women,"" said Chaser Angelina Johnson.  ""And women,"" Wood agreed. ""This is it.""  ""The big one,"" said Fred Weasley.  ""The one we've all been waiting for,"" said George.  ""We know Oliver's speech by heart,"" Fred told Harry, ""we were on the team last year.""  ""Shut up, you two,"" said Wood. ""This is the best team Gryffindor's had in years. We're going to win. I know it.""  He glared at them all as if to say, ""Or else.""  ""Right. It's time. Good luck, all of you.""  Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his knees weren't going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.  Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand.  ""Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,"" she said, once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year. Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver.  ""Mount your brooms, please.""  Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand.  Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle.  Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off.  ""And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor -- what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too--""  ""JORDAN!""  ""Sorry, Professor.""  The Weasley twins' friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.  ""And she's really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood's, last year only a reserve -- back to Johnson and -- no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes -- Flint flying like an eagle up there -- he's going to sc -- no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle -- that's Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and -- OUCH -- that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger -- Quaffle taken by the Slytherins -- that's Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he's blocked by a second Bludger -- sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can't tell which -- nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes -- she's really flying -- dodges a speeding Bludger -- the goal posts are ahead -- come on, now, Angelina -- Keeper Bletchley dives -- misses -- GRYFFINDORS SCORE!""  Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins.  ""Budge up there, move along.""  ""Hagrid!""  Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join them.  ""Bin watchin' from me hut,"" said Hagrid, patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck, ""But it isn't the same as bein' in the crowd. No sign of the Snitch yet, eh?""  ""Nope,"" said Ron. ""Harry hasn't had much to do yet.""  ""Kept outta trouble, though, that's somethin',"" said Hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry.  Way up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood's game plan.  ""Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch,"" Wood had said. ""We don't want you attacked before you have to be.""  When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-loops to let off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch. Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys' wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it.  ""All right there, Harry?"" he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint.  ""Slytherin in possession,"" Lee Jordan was saying, ""Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the -- wait a moment -- was that the Snitch?""  A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear.  Harry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch -- all the Chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch.  Harry was faster than Higgs -- he could see the little round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead -- he put on an extra spurt of speed --  WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below -- Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry's broom spun off course, Harry holding on for dear life.  ""Foul!"" screamed the Gryffindors.  Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again.  Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, ""Send him off, ref! Red card!""  ""What are you talking about, Dean?"" said Ron.  ""Red card!"" said Dean furiously. ""In soccer you get shown the red card and you're out of the game!""  ""But this isn't soccer, Dean,"" Ron reminded him.  Hagrid, however, was on Dean's side.  ""They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air.""  Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.  ""So -- after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating--""  ""Jordan!"" growled Professor McGonagall.  ""I mean, after that open and revolting foul...""  ""Jordan, I'm warning you--""  ""All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I'm sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinner, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.""  It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees. He'd never felt anything like that.  It happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal-posts -- he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out -- and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control. He couldn't turn it. He couldn't direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him.  Lee was still commentating.  ""Slytherin in possession -- Flint with the Quaffle -- passes Spinnet -- passes Bell -- hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose -- only joking, Professor -- Slytherins score -- A no...""  The Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed that Harry's broom was behaving strangely. It was carrying him slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went.  ""Dunno what Harry thinks he's doing,"" Hagrid mumbled. He stared through his binoculars. ""If I didn' know better, I'd say he'd lost control of his broom... but he can't have...""  Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry's broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand.  ""Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?"" Seamus whispered.  ""Can't have,"" Hagrid said, his voice shaking. ""Can't nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic -- no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand.""  At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid's binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd.  ""What are you doing?"" moaned Ron, gray-faced.  ""I knew it,"" Hermione gasped, ""Snape -- look.""  Ron grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath.  ""He's doing something -- jinxing the broom,"" said Hermione.  ""What should we do?""  ""Leave it to me.""  Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared. Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good - every time they got near him, the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing.  ""Come on, Hermione,"" Ron muttered desperately.  Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; she didn't even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front. Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape's robes.  It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire. A sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row -- Snape would never know what had happened.  It was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom.  ""Neville, you can look!"" Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into Hagrid's jacket for the last five minutes.  Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick -- he hit the field on all fours -- coughed -- and something gold fell into his hand.  ""I've got the Snitch!"" he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game ended in complete confusion.  ""He didn't catch it, he nearly swallowed it,"" Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference -- Harry hadn't broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results -- Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid's hut, with Ron and Hermione.  ""It was Snape,"" Ron was explaining, ""Hermione and I saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn't take his eyes off you.""  ""Rubbish,"" said Hagrid, who hadn't heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands. ""Why would Snape do somethin' like that?""  Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him. Harry decided on the truth.  ""I found out something about him,"" he told Hagrid. ""He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever it's guarding.""  Hagrid dropped the teapot.  ""How do you know about Fluffy?"" he said.  ""Fluffy ?""  ""Yeah -- he's mine -- bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las' year -- I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the--""  ""Yes?"" said Harry eagerly.  ""Now, don't ask me anymore,"" said Hagrid gruffly. ""That's top secret, that is.""  ""But Snape's trying to steal it.""  ""Rubbish,"" said Hagrid again. ""Snape's a Hogwarts teacher, he'd do nothin' of the sort.""  ""So why did he just try and kill Harry?"" cried Hermione.  The afternoon's events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape.  ""I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I've read all about them! You've got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn't blinking at all, I saw him!""  ""I'm tellin' yeh, yer wrong!"" said Hagrid hotly. ""I don' know why Harry's broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn' try an' kill a student! Now, listen to me, all three of yeh -- yer meddlin' in things that don' concern yeh. It's dangerous. You forget that dog, an' you forget what it's guardin', that's between Professor Dumbledore an' Nicolas Flamel--""  ""Aha!"" said Harry, ""so there's someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?""  Hagrid looked furious with himself."
Harry Potter 1 Chapter 12,"Christmas was coming. One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again.  No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape's classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons.  ""I do feel so sorry,"" said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, ""for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they're not wanted at home.""  He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he'd realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family.  It was true that Harry wasn't going back to Privet Drive for Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once. He didn't feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas he'd ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie.  When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it.  ""Hi, Hagrid, want any help?"" Ron asked, sticking his head through the branches.  ""Nah, I'm all right, thanks, Ron.""  ""Would you mind moving out of the way?"" came Malfoy's cold drawl from behind them. ""Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose -- that hut of Hagrid's must seem like a palace compared to what your family's used to.""  Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.  ""WEASLEY!""  Ron let go of the front of Malfoy's robes.  ""He was provoked, Professor Snape,"" said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree. ""Malfoy was insultin' his family.""  ""Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,"" said Snape silkily. ""Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn't more. Move along, all of you.""  Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking.  ""I'll get him,"" said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy's back, ""one of these days, I'll get him--""  ""I hate them both,"" said Harry, ""Malfoy and Snape.""  ""Come on, cheer up, it's nearly Christmas,"" said Hagrid. ""Tell yeh what, come with me an' see the Great Hall, looks a treat.""  So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations.  ""Ah, Hagrid, the last tree -- put it in the far corner, would you?""  The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles.  ""How many days you got left until yer holidays?"" Hagrid asked.  ""Just one,"" said Hermione. ""And that reminds me -- Harry, Ron, we've got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.""  ""Oh yeah, you're right,"" said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.  ""The library?"" said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. ""Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren't yeh?""  ""Oh, we're not working,"" Harry told him brightly. ""Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we've been trying to find out who he is.""  ""You what ?"" Hagrid looked shocked. ""Listen here -- I've told yeh -- drop it. It's nothin' to you what that dog's guardin'.""  ""We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that's all,"" said Hermione.  ""Unless you'd like to tell us and save us the trouble?"" Harry added. ""We must've been through hundreds of books already and we can't find him anywhere -- just give us a hint -- I know I've read his name somewhere.""  ""I'm sayin' nothin', said Hagrid flatly.  ""Just have to find out for ourselves, then,"" said Ron, and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.  They had indeed been searching books for Flamel's name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. He wasn't in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time ; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.  Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn't somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he'd never get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.  ""What are you looking for, boy?""  ""Nothing,"" said Harry.  Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him.  ""You'd better get out, then. Go on -- out!""  Wishing he'd been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they'd better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she'd be able to tell them, but they couldn't risk Snape hearing what they were up to.  Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn't very hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks, after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn't surprising they'd found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.  Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads. They went off to lunch.  ""You will keep looking while I'm away, won't you?"" said Hermione. ""And send me an owl if you find anything.""  ""And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,"" said Ron. ""It'd be safe to ask them.""  ""Very safe, as they're both dentists,"" said Hermione.  Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork -- bread, English muffins, marshmallows -- and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn't work.  Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle. Ron's set was very old and battered. Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family -- in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren't a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted.  Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn't trust him at all. He wasn't a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. ""Don't send me there, can't you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose him.""  On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all. When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed.  ""Merry Christmas,"" said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe.  ""You, too,"" said Harry. ""Will you look at this? I've got some presents!""  ""What did you expect, turnips?"" said Ron, turning to his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry's.  Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it -- it sounded a bit like an owl.  A second, very small parcel contained a note.  We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece.  ""That's friendly,"" said Harry.  Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence.  ""Weird!"" he said, ""What a shape! This is money ?""  ""You can keep it,"" said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. ""Hagrid and my aunt and uncle -- so who sent these?""  ""I think I know who that one's from,"" said Ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel. ""My mom. I told her you didn't expect any presents and -- oh, no,"" he groaned, ""she's made you a Weasley sweater.""  Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.  ""Every year she makes us a sweater,"" said Ron, unwrapping his own, ""and mine's always maroon.""  ""That's really nice of her,"" said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty.  His next present also contained candy -- a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione.  This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very light. He unwrapped it.  Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped.  ""I've heard of those,"" he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he'd gotten from Hermione. ""If that's what I think it is -- they're really rare, and really valuable.""  ""What is it?""  Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material.  ""It's an invisibility cloak,"" said Ron, a look of awe on his face. ""I'm sure it is -- try it on.""  Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.  ""It is! Look down!""  Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely.  ""There's a note!"" said Ron suddenly. ""A note fell out of it!""  Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words:  Your father left this in my possession before he died.  It is time it was returned to you.  Use it well.  A Very Merry Christmas to you.  There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the cloak.  ""I'd give anything for one of these,"" he said. ""Anything. What's the matter?""  ""Nothing,"" said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father?  Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight. He didn't feel like sharing it with anyone else yet.  ""Merry Christmas!""  ""Hey, look -- Harry's got a Weasley sweater, too!""  Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G.  ""Harry's is better than ours, though,"" said Fred, holding up Harry's sweater. ""She obviously makes more of an effort if you're not family.""  ""Why aren't you wearing yours, Ron?"" George demanded. ""Come on, get it on, they're lovely and warm.""  ""I hate maroon,"" Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head.  ""You haven't got a letter on yours,"" George observed. ""I suppose she thinks you don't forget your name. But we're not stupid -- we know we're called Gred and Forge.""  ""What's all this noise?""  Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized.  ""P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we're all wearing ours, even Harry got one.""  ""I -- don't -- want -- "" said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew.  ""And you're not sitting with the prefects today, either,"" said George. ""Christmas is a time for family.""  They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater.  Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce - and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn't just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral's hat and several live, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard's hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him.  Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry's amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.  When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set. The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. Norris's Christmas dinner.  Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn't have lost so badly if Percy hadn't tried to help him so much.  After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because they'd stolen his prefect badge.  It had been Harry's best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it.  Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he'd drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it.  His father's... this had been his father's. He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note had said.  He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a very funny feeling.  Use it well.  Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know.  Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him back -- his father's cloak -- he felt that this time -- the first time -- he wanted to use it alone.  He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole.  ""Who's there?"" squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked quickly down the corridor.  Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He'd be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was. He set off, drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked.  The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps.  The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Stepping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles.  They didn't tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn't understand. Some had no title at all. One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back of Harry's neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be.  He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting looking book. A large black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open.  A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence -- the book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside -- stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch's pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch's outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book's shrieks still ringing in his ears.  He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn't paid attention to where he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn't recognize where he was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there.  ""You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody's been in the library Restricted Section.""  Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, ""The Restricted Section? Well, they can't be far, we'll catch them.""  Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead. They couldn't see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they'd knock right into him -- the cloak didn't stop him from being solid.  He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.  It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket -- but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn't look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way.  It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it.  He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed -- for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him.  But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror.  There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder -- but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror's trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not?  He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he'd touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air - she and the others existed only in the mirror.  She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes -- her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright green -- exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry's did.  Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection.  ""Mom?"" he whispered. ""Dad?""  They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry's knobbly knees -- Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.  The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.  How long he stood there, he didn't know. The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. He couldn't stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother's face, whispered, ""I'll come back,"" and hurried from the room.  ""You could have woken me up,"" said Ron, crossly.  ""You can come tonight, I'm going back, I want to show you the mirror.  ""I'd like to see your mom and dad,"" Ron said eagerly.  ""And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you'll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone.""  ""You can see them any old time,"" said Ron. ""Just come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren't you eating anything?""  Harry couldn't eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn't seem very important anymore. Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really?  ""Are you all right?"" said Ron. ""You look odd.""  What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry's route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.  ""I'm freezing,"" said Ron. ""Let's forget it and go back.""  ""No!"" Harry hissed. I know it's here somewhere.""  They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else. just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.  ""It's here -- just here -- yes!""  They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror.  There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him.  ""See?"" Harry whispered.  ""I can't see anything.""  ""Look! Look at them all... there are loads of them...""  ""I can only see you.""  ""Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.""  Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn't see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.  Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image.  ""Look at me!"" he said.  ""Can you see all your family standing around you?""  ""No -- I'm alone -- but I'm different -- I look older -- and I'm head boy!""  ""What?""  ""I am -- I'm wearing the badge like Bill used to -- and I'm holding the house cup and the Quidditch cup -- I'm Quidditch captain, too.""  Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry.  ""Do you think this mirror shows the future?""  ""How can it? All my family are dead -- let me have another look--""  ""You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.""  ""You're only holding the Quidditch cup, what's interesting about that? I want to see my parents.""  ""Don't push me--""  A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion. They hadn't realized how loudly they had been talking.  ""Quick!""  Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing -- did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she turned and left.  ""This isn't safe -- she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us. Come on.""  And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.  The snow still hadn't melted the next morning.  ""Want to play chess, Harry?"" said Ron.  ""No.""  ""Why don't we go down and visit Hagrid?""  ""No... you go...""  ""I know what you're thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don't go back tonight.""  ""Why not?""  ""I dunno, I've just got a bad feeling about it -- and anyway, you've had too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. So what if they can't see you? What if they walk into you? What if you knock something over?""  ""You sound like Hermione.""  ""I'm serious, Harry, don't go.""  But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn't going to stop him.  That third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn't meet anyone.  And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family. Nothing at all.  Except --  ""So -- back again, Harry?""  Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn't noticed him.  ""I -- I didn't see you, sir.""  ""Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,"" said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.  ""So,"" said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, ""you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.""  ""I didn't know it was called that, Sir.""  ""But I expect you've realized by now what it does?""  ""It -- well -- it shows me my family--""  ""And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy.""  ""How did you know -- ?""  ""I don't need a cloak to become invisible,"" said Dumbledore gently. ""Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?""  Harry shook his head.  ""Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?""  Harry thought. Then he said slowly, ""It shows us what we want... whatever we want...""  ""Yes and no,"" said Dumbledore quietly. ""It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.  ""The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that. Now, why don't you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?""  Harry stood up.  ""Sir -- Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?""  ""Obviously, you've just done so,"" Dumbledore smiled. ""You may ask me one more thing, however.""  ""What do you see when you look in the mirror?""  ""I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.""  Harry stared.  ""One can never have enough socks,"" said Dumbledore. ""Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn't get a single pair. People will insist on giving me books.""  It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question."
Harry Potter 1 Chapter 13,"Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he could forget what he'd seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn't. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.  ""You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,"" said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams.  Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (""If Filch had caught you!""), and disappointment that he hadn't at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was.  They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book, even though Harry was still sure he'd read the name somewhere. Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again.  Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn't dampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood's side. If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years. Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training.  Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He'd just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms.  ""Will you stop messing around!"" he yelled. ""That's exactly the sort of thing that'll lose us the match! Snape's refereeing this time, and he'll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!""  George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.  ""Snape's refereeing?"" he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. ""When's he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He's not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin.""  The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.  ""It's not my fault,"" said Wood. ""We've just got to make sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn't got an excuse to pick on us.""  Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch...  The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.  ""Don't talk to me for a moment,"" said Ron when Harry sat down next to him, ""I need to concen -- "" He caught sight of Harry's face.  ""What's the matter with you? You look terrible.""  Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape's sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.  ""Don't play,"" said Hermione at once.  ""Say you're ill,"" said Ron.  ""Pretend to break your leg,"" Hermione suggested.  ""Really break your leg,"" said Ron.  ""I can't,"" said Harry. ""There isn't a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor can't play at all.""  At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone's guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower.  Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville's legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling. ""What happened?"" Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with Harry and Ron.  ""Malfoy,"" said Neville shakily. ""I met him outside the library. He said he'd been looking for someone to practice that on.""  ""Go to Professor McGonagall!"" Hermione urged Neville. ""Report him!""  Neville shook his head.  ""I don't want more trouble,"" he mumbled.  ""You've got to stand up to him, Neville!"" said Ron. ""He's used to walking all over people, but that's no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier.""  ""There's no need to tell me I'm not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy's already done that,"" Neville choked out.  Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas. He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry.  ""You're worth twelve of Malfoy,"" Harry said. ""The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn't it? And where's Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.""  Neville's lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog.  ""Thanks, Harry... I think I'll go to bed... D'you want the card, you collect them, don't you?""  As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.  ""Dumbledore again,"" he said, ""He was the first one I ever--""  He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione.  ""I've found him!"" he whispered. ""I've found Flamel! I told you I'd read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here -- listen to this: 'Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel'!""  Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadn't looked so excited since they'd gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.  ""Stay there!"" she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls' dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.  ""I never thought to look in here!"" she whispered excitedly. ""I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.""  ""Light ?"" said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she'd looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself.  At last she found what she was looking for.  ""I knew it! I knew it!""  ""Are we allowed to speak yet?"" said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him.  ""Nicolas Flamel,"" she whispered dramatically, ""is the only known maker of the Sorcerer's Stone!""  This didn't have quite the effect she'd expected.  ""The what?"" said Harry and Ron.  ""Oh, honestly, don't you two read? Look -- read that, there.""  She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read:  The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer's Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.  There have been many reports of the Sorcerer's Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight).  ""See?"" said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. ""The dog must be guarding Flamel's Sorcerer's Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they're friends and he knew someone was after it, that's why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!""  ""A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!"" said Harry. ""No wonder Snape's after it! Anyone would want it.""  ""And no wonder we couldn't find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,"" said Ron. ""He's not exactly recent if he's six hundred and sixty-five, is he?""  The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they'd do with a Sorcerer's Stone if they had one. It wasn't until Ron said he'd buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.  ""I'm going to play,"" he told Ron and Hermione. ""If I don't, all the Slytherins will think I'm just too scared to face Snape. I'll show them... it'll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.""  ""Just as long as we're not wiping you off the field,"" said Hermione.  As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn't too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee?  Harry didn't know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they'd found out about the Sorcerer's Stone? Harry didn't see how he could -- yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.  Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they'd ever see him alive again. This wasn't what you'd call comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood's pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.  Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn't understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They'd gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.  ""Now, don't forget, it's Locomotor Mortis,"" Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve.  ""I know,"" Ron snapped. ""Don't nag.""  Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.  ""Don't want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it's now. Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.""  ""The whole school's out there!"" said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door. ""Even -- blimey -- Dumbledore's come to watch!""  Harry's heart did a somersault.  ""Dumbledore?"" he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was right. There was no mistaking that silver beard.  Harry could have laughed out loud with relief He was safe. There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching.  Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too.  ""I've never seen Snape look so mean,"" he told Hermione. ""Look -- they're off. Ouch!""  Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy.  ""Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn't see you there.""  Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.  ""Wonder how long Potter's going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?""  Ron didn't answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.  ""You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?"" said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. ""It's people they feel sorry for. See, there's Potter, who's got no parents, then there's the Weasleys, who've got no money -- you should be on the team, Longbottom, you've got no brains.""  Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy.  ""I'm worth twelve of you, Malfoy,"" he stammered.  Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, ""You tell him, Neville.""  ""Longbottom, if brains were gold you'd be poorer than Weasley, and that's saying something.""  Ron's nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.  ""I'm warning you, Malfoy -- one more word--""  ""Ron!"" said Hermione suddenly, ""Harry--""  ""What? Where?""  Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.  ""You're in luck, Weasley, Potter's obviously spotted some money on the ground!"" said Malfoy.  Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help.  ""Come on, Harry!"" Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape -- she didn't even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.  Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches -- the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand.  The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so quickly.  ""Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game's over! Harry's won! We've won! Gryffindor is in the lead!"" shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.  Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn't believe it. He'd done it -- the game was over; it had barely lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped -- then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore's smiling face.  ""Well done,"" said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear. ""Nice to see you haven't been brooding about that mirror... been keeping busy... excellent...""  Snape spat bitterly on the ground.  Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldn't ever remember feeling happier. He'd really done something to be proud of now -- no one could say he was just a famous name any more. The evening air had never smelled so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.  Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun. Gryffindor in the lead. He'd done it, he'd shown Snape...  And speaking of Snape...  A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest. Harry's victory faded from his mind as he watched. He recognized the figure's prowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner -- what was going on?  Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off. Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run. He followed.  The trees were so thick he couldn't see where Snape had gone. He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree.  He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves.  Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn't alone. Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldn't make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they were saying.  ""... d-don't know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places, Severus...""  ""Oh, I thought we'd keep this private,"" said Snape, his voice icy. ""Students aren't supposed to know about the Sorcerer's Stone, after all.""  Harry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape interrupted him.  ""Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?""  ""B-b-but Severus, I--""  ""You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell,"" said Snape, taking a step toward him.  ""I-I don't know what you--""  ""You know perfectly well what I mean.""  An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, "" -- your little bit of hocus-pocus. I'm waiting.""  ""B-but I d-d-don't--""  ""Very well,"" Snape cut in. ""We'll have another little chat soon, when you've had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.""  He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified.  ""Harry, where have you been ?"" Hermione squeaked.  ""We won! You won! We won!"" shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back. ""And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed! He's still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says he'll be all right -- talk about showing Slytherin! I've waiting for you in the common room, we're having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.""  ""Never mind that now,"" said Harry breathlessly. ""Let's find an empty room, you wait 'til you hear this...""  He made sure Peeves wasn't inside before shutting the door behind them, then he told them what he'd seen and heard.  ""So we were right, it is the Sorcerer's Stone, and Snape's trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy -- and he said something about Quirrell's 'hocus pocus' -- I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through--""  ""So you mean the Stone's only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape?"" said Hermione in alarm.  ""It'll be gone by next Tuesday,"" said Ron."
Harry Potter 1 Chapter 14,"Quirrell, however, must have been braver than they'd thought. In the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it didn't look as though he'd cracked yet.  Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which surely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell's stutter.  Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer's Stone. She had started drawing up study schedules and color coding all her notes. Harry and Ron wouldn't have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same.  ""Hermione, the exams are ages away.""  ""Ten weeks,"" Hermione snapped. ""That's not ages, that's like a second to Nicolas Flamel.""  ""But we're not six hundred years old,"" Ron reminded her. ""Anyway, what are you studying for, you already know it's an A.""  ""What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year? They're very important, I should have started studying a month ago, I don't know what's gotten into me...""  Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as Hermione. They piled so much homework on them that the Easter holidays weren't nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon's blood or practicing wand movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work.  ""I'll never remember this,"" Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was the first really fine day they'd had in months. The sky was a clear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming.  Harry, who was looking up ""Dittany"" in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn't look up until he heard Ron say, ""Hagrid! What are you doing in the library?""  Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back. He looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat.  ""Jus' lookin',"" he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at once. ""An' what're you lot up ter?"" He looked suddenly suspicious. ""Yer not still lookin' fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?""  ""Oh, we found out who he is ages ago,"" said Ron impressively. ""And we know what that dog's guarding, it's a Sorcerer's St--""  ""Shhhh!"" Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening. ""Don' go shoutin' about it, what's the matter with yeh?""  ""There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,"" said Harry, ""about what's guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy--""  ""SHHHH!"" said Hagrid again. ""Listen -- come an' see me later, I'm not promisin' I'll tell yeh anythin', mind, but don' go rabbitin' about it in here, students aren' s'pposed ter know. They'll think I've told yeh--""  ""See you later, then,"" said Harry.  Hagrid shuffled off.  ""What was he hiding behind his back?"" said Hermione thoughtfully.  ""Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?""  ""I'm going to see what section he was in,"" said Ron, who'd had enough of working. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table.  ""Dragons!"" he whispered. ""Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper's Guide.""  ""Hagrid's always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him, "" said Harry.  ""But it's against our laws,"" said Ron. ""Dragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks' Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It's hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we're keeping dragons in the back garden -- anyway, you can't tame dragons, it's dangerous. You should see the burns Charlie's got off wild ones in Romania.""  ""But there aren't wild dragons in Britain ?"" said Harry.  ""Of course there are,"" said Ron. ""Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who've spotted them, to make them forget.""  ""So what on earth's Hagrid up to?"" said Hermione.  When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper's hut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid called ""Who is it?"" before he let them in, and then shut the door quickly behind them.  It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused.  ""So -- yeh wanted to ask me somethin'?""  ""Yes,"" said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. ""We were wondering if you could tell us what's guarding the Sorcerer's Stone apart from Fluffy.""  Hagrid frowned at him.  ""O' course I can't,"" he said. ""Number one, I don' know meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn' tell yeh if I could. That Stone's here fer a good reason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts -- I s'ppose yeh've worked that out an' all? Beats me how yeh even know abou' Fluffy.""  ""Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here,"" said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice. Hagrid's beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling. ""We only wondered who had done the guarding, really."" Hermione went on. ""We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you.""  Hagrid's chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione.  ""Well, I don' s'pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that... let's see... he borrowed Fluffy from me... then some o' the teachers did enchantments... Professor Sprout -- Professor Flitwick -- Professor McGonagall -- "" he ticked them off on his fingers, ""Professor Quirrell -- an' Dumbledore himself did somethin', o' course. Hang on, I've forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor Snape.""  ""Snape?""  ""Yeah -- yer not still on abou' that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped protect the Stone, he's not about ter steal it.""  Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything -- except, it seemed, Quirrell's spell and how to get past Fluffy.  ""You're the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy. aren't you, Hagrid?"" said Harry anxiously. ""And you wouldn't tell anyone, would you? Not even one of the teachers?""  ""Not a soul knows except me an' Dumbledore,"" said Hagrid proudly.  ""Well, that's something,"" Harry muttered to the others. ""Hagrid, can we have a window open? I'm boiling.""  ""Can't, Harry, sorry,"" said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at the fire. Harry looked at it, too.  ""Hagrid -- what's that ?""  But he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg.  ""Ah,"" said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, ""That's -- er...""  ""Where did you get it, Hagrid?"" said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg. ""It must've cost you a fortune.""  ""Won it,"" said Hagrid. ""Las' night. I was down in the village havin' a few drinks an' got into a game o' cards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.""  ""But what are you going to do with it when it's hatched?"" said Hermione.  ""Well, I've bin doin' some readin',"" said Hagrid, pulling a large book from under his pillow. ""Got this outta the library -- Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit -- it's a bit outta date, o' course, but it's all in here. Keep the egg in the fire, 'cause their mothers breathe on I em, see, an' when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o' brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An' see here -- how ter recognize diff'rent eggs -- what I got there's a Norwegian Ridgeback. They're rare, them.""  He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn't.  ""Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,"" she said.  But Hagrid wasn't listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the fire.  So now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.  ""Wonder what it's like to have a peaceful life,"" Ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts.  Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid. He had written only two words: It's hatching.  Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione wouldn't hear of it.  ""Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?""  ""We've got lessons, we'll get into trouble, and that's nothing to what Hagrid's going to be in when someone finds out what he's doing--""  ""Shut up!"" Harry whispered.  Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How much had he heard? Harry didn't like the look on Malfoy's face at all.  Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid's with the other two during morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited.  ""It's nearly out."" He ushered them inside.  The egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it.  They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath.  All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The baby dragon flopped onto the table. It wasn't exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes.  It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.  ""Isn't he beautiful ?"" Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand to stroke the dragon's head. It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs.  ""Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!"" said Hagrid.  ""Hagrid,"" said Hermione, ""how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?""  Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face -- he leapt to his feet and ran to the window.  ""What's the matter?""  ""Someone was lookin' through the gap in the curtains -- it's a kid -- he's runnin' back up ter the school.""  Harry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance there was no mistaking him.  Malfoy had seen the dragon.  Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy's face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They spent most of their free time in Hagrid's darkened hut, trying to reason with him.  ""Just let him go,"" Harry urged. ""Set him free.""  ""I can't,"" said Hagrid. ""He's too little. He'd die.""  They looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in just a week. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn't been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. There were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor.  ""I've decided to call him Norbert,"" said Hagrid, looking at the dragon with misty eyes. ""He really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where's Mommy?""  ""He's lost his marbles,"" Ron muttered in Harry's ear.  ""Hagrid,"" said Harry loudly, ""give it two weeks and Norbert's going to be as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment.""  Hagrid bit his lip.  ""I -- I know I can't keep him forever, but I can't jus' dump him, I can't.""  Harry suddenly turned to Ron. ""Charlie."" he said.  ""You're losing it, too,"" said Ron. ""I'm Ron, remember?""  ""No -- Charlie -- your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying dragons. We could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild!""  ""Brilliant!"" said Ron. ""How about it, Hagrid?""  And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to Charlie to ask him.  The following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed. The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry's invisibility cloak. He had been down at Hagrid's hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate.  ""It bit me!"" he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. ""I'm not going to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that dragon's the most horrible animal I've ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you'd think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby.""  There was a tap on the dark window.  ""It's Hedwig!"" said Harry, hurrying to let her in. ""She'll have Charlie's answer!""  The three of them put their heads together to read the note.  Dear Ron,  How are you? Thanks for the letter -- I'd be glad to take the Norwegian Ridgeback, but it won't be easy getting him here. I think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn't be seen carrying an illegal dragon.  Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and take him away while it's still dark.  Send me an answer as soon as possible.  Love,  Charlie  They looked at one another.  ""We've got the invisibility cloak,"" said Harry. ""It shouldn't be too difficult - I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and Norbert.""  It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert -- and Malfoy.  There was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron's bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size. He didn't know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey -- would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked as if Norbert's fangs were poisonous.  Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.  ""It's not just my hand,"" he whispered, ""although that feels like it's about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me -- I've told her it was a dog, but I don't think she believes me -- I shouldn't have hit him at the Quidditch match, that's why he's doing this.""  Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.  ""It'll all be over at midnight on Saturday,"" said Hermione, but this didn't soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat.  ""Midnight on Saturday!"" he said in a hoarse voice. ""Oh no oh no -- I've just remembered -- Charlie's letter was in that book Malfoy took, he's going to know we're getting rid of Norbert.""  Harry and Hermione didn't get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.  ""It's too late to change the plan now,"" Harry told Hermione. ""We haven't got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert. We'll have to risk it. And we have got the invisibility cloak, Malfoy doesn't know about that.""  They found Fang, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them.  ""I won't let you in,"" he puffed. ""Norbert's at a tricky stage -- nothin' I can't handle.""  When they told him about Charlie's letter, his eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg.  ""Aargh! It's all right, he only got my boot -- jus' playin' -- he's only a baby, after all.""  The baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle. Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn't come quickly enough.  They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say good-bye to Norbert if they hadn't been so worried about what they had to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late arriving at Hagrid's hut because they'd had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall, where he'd been playing tennis against the wall. Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate.  ""He's got lots o' rats an' some brandy fer the journey,"" said Hagrid in a muffled voice. ""An' I've packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely.""  From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off.  ""Bye-bye, Norbert!"" Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves. ""Mommy will never forget you!""  How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors. Up another staircase, then another -- even one of Harry's shortcuts didn't make the work much easier.  ""Nearly there!"" Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower.  Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate. Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away. A lamp flared.  Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear.  ""Detention!"" she shouted. ""And twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you--""  ""You don't understand, Professor. Harry Potter's coming -- he's got a dragon!""  ""What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on -- I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!""  The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not until they'd stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.  ""Malfoy's got detention! I could sing!""  ""Don't,"" Harry advised her.  Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his crate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness.  Charlie's friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they'd rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them. They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much.  At last, Norbert was going... going... gone.  They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon -- Malfoy in detention -- what could spoil their happiness?  The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they stepped into the corridor, Filch's face loomed suddenly out of the darkness.  ""Well, well, well,"" he whispered, ""we are in trouble.""  They'd left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower."
Harry Potter 1 Chapter 15,"Things couldn't have been worse.  Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall's study on the first floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other. Hermione was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories chased each other around Harry's brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldn't see how they were going to get out of trouble this time. They were cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the invisibility cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already.  Had Harry thought that things couldn't have been worse? He was wrong. When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville.  ""Harry!"" Neville burst out, the moment he saw the other two. ""I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he said you had a drag--""  Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over the three of them.  ""I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you were up in the astronomy tower. It's one o'clock in the morning. Explain yourselves.""  It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher's question. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue.  ""I think I've got a good idea of what's been going on,"" said Professor McGonagall. ""It doesn't take a genius to work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed and into trouble. I've already caught him. I suppose you think it's funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it, too?""  Harry caught Neville's eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasn't true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering Neville -- Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark, to warn them.  ""I'm disgusted,"" said Professor McGonagall. ""Four students out of bed in one night! I've never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of you will receive detentions -- yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it's very dangerous -- and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor.""  ""Fifty ?"" Harry gasped -- they would lose the lead, the lead he'd won in the last Quidditch match.  ""Fifty points each,"" said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose.  ""Professor -- please--""  ""You can't--""  ""Don't tell me what I can and can't do, Potter. Now get back to bed, all of you. I've never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students.""  A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In one night, they'd ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house cup. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. How could they ever make up for this?  Harry didn't sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn't think of anything to say to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the dawn. What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they'd done?  At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought there'd been a mistake. How could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lost them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years.  From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the house cup. Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn't trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and cheering, ""Thanks Potter, we owe you one!""  Only Ron stood by him.  ""They'll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they've been here, and people still like them.""  ""They've never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have they?"" said Harry miserably.  ""Well -- no,"" Ron admitted.  It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren't his business from now on. He'd had it with sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.  ""Resign ?"" Wood thundered. ""What good'll that do? How are we going to get any points back if we can't win at Quidditch?""  But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn't speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him ""the Seeker.""  Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn't have as bad a time as Harry, because they weren't as well-known, but nobody would speak to them, either. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in silence.  Harry was almost glad that the exams weren't far away. All the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions...  Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry's new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn't concern him was put to an unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he heard Quirrell's voice.  ""No -- no -- not again, please--""  It sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry moved closer.  ""All right -- all right -- "" he heard Quirrell sob.  Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry. He strode out of sight; Harry didn't think Quirrell had even noticed him. He waited until Quirrell's footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he'd promised himself about not meddling.  All the same, he'd have gambled twelve Sorcerer's Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step -- Quirrell seemed to have given in at last.  Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy. Harry told them what he'd heard.  ""Snape's done it, then!"" said Ron. ""If Quirrell's told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell--""  ""There's still Fluffy, though,"" said Hermione.  ""Maybe Snape's found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,"" said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. ""I bet there's a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?""  The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron's eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could.  ""Go to Dumbledore. That's what we should have done ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we'll be thrown out for sure.""  ""But we've got no proof!"" said Harry. ""Quirrell's too scared to back us up. Snape's only got to say he doesn't know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor -- who do you think they'll believe, him or us? It's not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore'll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn't help us if his life depended on it, he's too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he'll think. And don't forget, we're not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That'll take a lot of explaining.""  Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn't.  ""If we just do a bit of poking around--""  ""No,"" said Harry flatly, ""we've done enough poking around.""  He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons.  The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table. They were all the same:  Your detention will take place at eleven o'clock tonight.  Meet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall.  Professor McGonagall  Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they'd lost. He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn't say a word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved what they'd got.  At eleven o'clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch was already there -- and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too.  ""Follow me,"" said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside.  ""I bet you'll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won't you, eh?"" he said, leering at them. ""Oh yes... hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me... It's just a pity they let the old punishments die out... hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I've got the chains still in my office, keep 'em well oiled in case they're ever needed... Right, off we go, and don't think of running off, now, it'll be worse for you if you do.""  They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn't be sounding so delighted.  The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid's hut. Then they heard a distant shout.  ""Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.""  Harry's heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it wouldn't be so bad. His relief must have showed in his face, because Filch said, ""I suppose you think you'll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? Well, think again, boy -- it's into the forest you're going and I'm much mistaken if you'll all come out in one piece.""  At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his tracks.  ""The forest?"" he repeated, and he didn't sound quite as cool as usual. ""We can't go in there at night -- there's all sorts of things in there -- werewolves, I heard.""  Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry's robe and made a choking noise.  ""That's your problem, isn't it?"" said Filch, his voice cracking with glee. ""Should've thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn't you?""  Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel. He was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder.  ""Abou' time,"" he said. ""I bin waitin' fer half an hour already. All right, Harry, Hermione?""  ""I shouldn't be too friendly to them, Hagrid,"" said Filch coldly, they're here to be punished, after all.""  ""That's why yer late, is it?"" said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. ""Bin lecturin' them, eh? 'Snot your place ter do that. Yeh've done yer bit, I'll take over from here.""  ""I'll be back at dawn,"" said Filch, ""for what's left of them,"" he added nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the darkness.  Malfoy now turned to Hagrid.  ""I'm not going in that forest,"" he said, and Harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice.  ""Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,"" said Hagrid fiercely. ""Yeh've done wrong an' now yeh've got ter pay fer it.""  ""But this is servant stuff, it's not for students to do. I thought we'd be copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he'd--""  ""-- tell yer that's how it is at Hogwarts,"" Hagrid growled. ""Copyin' lines! What good's that ter anyone? Yeh'll do summat useful or yeh'll get out. If yeh think yer father'd rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an' pack. Go on.""  Malfoy didn't move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then dropped his gaze.  ""Right then,"" said Hagrid, ""now, listen carefully, 'cause it's dangerous what we're gonna do tonight, an' I don' want no one takin' risks. Follow me over here a moment.""  He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest.  ""Look there,"" said Hagrid, ""see that stuff shinin' on the ground? Silvery stuff? That's unicorn blood. There's a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday. We're gonna try an' find the poor thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.""  ""And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?"" said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his voice.  ""There's nothin' that lives in the forest that'll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang,"" said Hagrid. ""An' keep ter the path. Right, now, we're gonna split inter two parties an' follow the trail in diff'rent directions. There's blood all over the place, it must've bin staggerin' around since last night at least.""  ""I want Fang,"" said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang's long teeth.  ""All right, but I warn yeh, he's a coward,"" said Hagrid. ""So me, Harry, an' Hermione'll go one way an' Draco, Neville, an' Fang'll go the other. Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we'll send up green sparks, right? Get yer wands out an' practice now -- that's it -- an' if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an' we'll all come an' find yeh -- so, be careful -- let's go.""  The forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right.  They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on the fallen leaves.  Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.  ""Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?"" Harry asked.  ""Not fast enough,"" said Hagrid. ""It's not easy ter catch a unicorn, they're powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before.""  They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running water; there must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path.  ""You all right, Hermione?"" Hagrid whispered. ""Don' worry, it can't've gone far if it's this badly hurt, an' then we'll be able ter -- GET BEHIND THAT TREE!""  Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away.  ""I knew it,"" he murmured. ""There's summat in here that shouldn' be.""  ""A werewolf?"" Harry suggested.  ""That wasn' no werewolf an' it wasn' no unicorn, neither,"" said Hagrid grimly. ""Right, follow me, but careful, now.""  They walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound. Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved.  ""Who's there?"" Hagrid called. ""Show yerself -- I'm armed!""  And into the clearing came -- was it a man, or a horse? To the waist, a man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse's gleaming chestnut body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione's jaws dropped.  ""Oh, it's you, Ronan,"" said Hagrid in relief. ""How are yeh?""  He walked forward and shook the centaur's hand.  ""Good evening to you, Hagrid,"" said Ronan. He had a deep, sorrowful voice. ""Were you going to shoot me?""  ""Can't be too careful, Ronan,"" said Hagrid, patting his crossbow. ""There's summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an' Hermione Granger, by the way. Students up at the school. An' this is Ronan, you two. He's a centaur.  ""We'd noticed,"" said Hermione faintly.  ""Good evening,"" said Ronan. ""Students, are you? And do you learn much, up at the school?""  ""Erm--""  ""A bit,"" said Hermione timidly.  ""A bit. Well, that's something."" Ronan sighed. He flung back his head and stared at the sky. ""Mars is bright tonight.""  ""Yeah,"" said Hagrid, glancing up, too. ""Listen, I'm glad we've run inter yeh, Ronan, 'cause there's a unicorn bin hurt -- you seen anythin'?""  Ronan didn't answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward, then sighed again.  ""Always the innocent are the first victims,"" he said. ""So it has been for ages past, so it is now.""  ""Yeah,"" said Hagrid, ""but have yeh seen anythin' Ronan? Anythin' unusual?""  ""Mars is bright tonight,"" Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him impatiently. ""Unusually bright.""  ""Yeah, but I was meanin' anythin' unusual a bit nearer home, said Hagrid. ""So yeh haven't noticed anythin' strange?""  Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, ""The forest hides many secrets.""  A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than Ronan.  ""Hullo, Bane,"" said Hagrid. ""All right?""  ""Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?""  ""Well enough. Look, I've jus' bin askin' Ronan, you seen anythin' odd in here lately? There's a unicorn bin injured -- would yeh know anythin' about it?""  Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward. ""Mars is bright tonight,"" he said simply.  ""We've heard,"" said Hagrid grumpily. ""Well, if either of you do see anythin', let me know, won't yeh? We'll be off, then.""  Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view.  ""Never,"" said Hagrid irritably, ""try an' get a straight answer out of a centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin' closer'n the moon.""  ""Are there many of them in here?"" asked Hermione.  ""Oh, a fair few... Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they're good enough about turnin' up if ever I want a word. They're deep, mind, centaurs... they know things... jus' don' let on much.""  ""D'you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?"" said Harry.  ""Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what's bin killin' the unicorns -- never heard anythin' like it before.""  They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were being watched. He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them. They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid's arm.  ""Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!""  ""You two wait here!"" Hagrid shouted. ""Stay on the path, I'll come back for yeh!""  They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn't hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them.  ""You don't think they've been hurt, do you?"" whispered Hermione.  ""I don't care if Malfoy has, but if something's got Neville... it's our fault he's here in the first place.""  The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Harry's seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was going on? Where were the others?  At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid's return. Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had panicked and sent up the sparks.  ""We'll be lucky ter catch anythin' now, with the racket you two were makin'. Right, we're changin' groups -- Neville, you stay with me an' Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an' this idiot. I'm sorry,"" Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry, ""but he'll have a harder time frightenin' you, an' we've gotta get this done.""  So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak.  ""Look -- "" he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.  Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer.  It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves.  Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered... Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal's side, and began to drink its blood.  ""AAAAAAAAAARGH!""  Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted -- so did Fang. The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry -- unicorn blood was dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry -- he couldn't move for fear.  Then a pain like he'd never felt before pierced his head; it was as though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure.  The pain in Harry's head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white-blond hair and a palomino body.  ""Are you all right?"" said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.  ""Yes -- thank you -- what was that?""  The centaur didn't answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry's forehead.  ""You are the Potter boy,"" he said. ""You had better get back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time -- especially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker this way.  ""My name is Firenze,"" he added, as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.  There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty.  ""Firenze!"" Bane thundered. ""What are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?""  ""Do you realize who this is?"" said Firenze. ""This is the Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the better.""  ""What have you been telling him?"" growled Bane. ""Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?""  Ronan pawed the ground nervously. ""I'm sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best,"" he said in his gloomy voice.  Bane kicked his back legs in anger.  ""For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!""  Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on.  ""Do you not see that unicorn?"" Firenze bellowed at Bane. ""Do you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must.""  And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.  Harry didn't have a clue what was going on.  ""Why's Bane so angry?"" he asked. ""What was that thing you saved me from, anyway?""  Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry's question. They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn't want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.  ""Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?""  ""No,"" said Harry, startled by the odd question. ""We've only used the horn and tail hair in Potions.""  ""That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,"" said Firenze. ""Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.""  Harry stared at the back of Firenze's head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight.  ""But who'd be that desperate?"" he wondered aloud. ""If you're going to be cursed forever, death's better, isn't it?""  ""It is,"" Firenze agreed, ""unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else -- something that will bring you back to full strength and power -- something that will mean you can never die. Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?""  ""The Sorcerer's Stone! Of course -- the Elixir of Life! But I don't understand who--""  ""Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?""  It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry's heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: ""Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die.""  ""Do you mean,"" Harry croaked, ""that was Vol-""  ""Harry! Harry, are you all right?""  Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind her.  ""I'm fine,"" said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. ""The unicorn's dead, Hagrid, it's in that clearing back there.""  ""This is where I leave you,"" Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. ""You are safe now.""  Harry slid off his back.  ""Good luck, Harry Potter,"" said Firenze. ""The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.""  He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him.  Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.  Harry couldn't sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He was still shaking.  ""Snape wants the stone for Voldemort... and Voldemort's waiting in the forest... and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich...""  ""Stop saying the name!"" said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them.  Harry wasn't listening.  ""Firenze saved me, but he shouldn't have done so... Bane was furious... he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen... They must show that Voldemort's coming back... Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me... I suppose that's written in the stars as well.""  ""Will you stop saying the name!"" Ron hissed.  ""So all I've got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,"" Harry went on feverishly, ""then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off... Well, I suppose Bane'll be happy.""  Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.  ""Harry, everyone says Dumbledore's the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of with Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won't touch you. Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says that's a very imprecise branch of magic.""  The sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But the night's surprises weren't over.  When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it:  Just in case."
Harry Potter 1 Chapter 17,"It was Quirrell.  ""You!"" gasped Harry.  Quirrell smiled. His face wasn't twitching at all.  ""Me,"" he said calmly. ""I wondered whether I'd be meeting you here, Potter.""  ""But I thought -- Snape--""  ""Severus?"" Quirrell laughed, and it wasn't his usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp. ""Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn't he? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?""  Harry couldn't take it in. This couldn't be true, it couldn't.  ""But Snape tried to kill me!""  ""No, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I'd have got you off that broom. I'd have managed it before then if Snape hadn't been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you.""  ""Snape was trying to save me?""  ""Of course,"" said Quirrell coolly. ""Why do you think he wanted to referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn't do it again. Funny, really... he needn't have bothered. I couldn't do anything with Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular... and what a waste of time, when after all that, I'm going to kill you tonight.""  Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry.  ""You're too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you'd seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone.""  ""You let the troll in?""  ""Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls -- you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off -- and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn't even manage to bite Snape's leg off properly.  ""Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.""  It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised.  ""This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,"" Quirrell murmured, tapping his way around the frame. ""Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this... but he's in London... I'll be far away by the time he gets back...""  All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror.  ""I saw you and Snape in the forest -- "" he blurted out.  ""Yes,"" said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back. ""He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I'd got. He suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me -- as though he could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side...""  Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it.  ""I see the Stone... I'm presenting it to my master... but where is it?""  Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn't give. He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.  ""But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.""  ""Oh, he does,"" said Quirrell casually, ""heavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts with your father, didn't you know? They loathed each other. But he never wanted you dead.""  ""But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing -- I thought Snape was threatening you...""  For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell's face.  ""Sometimes,"" he said, ""I find it hard to follow my master's instructions -- he is a great wizard and I am weak--""  ""You mean he was there in the classroom with you?"" Harry gasped.  ""He is with me wherever I go,"" said Quirrell quietly. ""I met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it... Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me."" Quirrell shivered suddenly. ""He does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me... decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me...""  Quirrell's voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley -- how could he have been so stupid? He'd seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.  Quirrell cursed under his breath.  ""I don't understand... is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?""  Harry's mind was racing.  What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see myself finding it -- which means I'll see where it's hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I'm up to?  He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to himself.  ""What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!""  And to Harry's horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself.  ""Use the boy... Use the boy...""  Quirrell rounded on Harry.  ""Yes -- Potter -- come here.""  He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry got slowly to his feet.  ""Come here,"" Quirrell repeated. ""Look in the mirror and tell me what you see.""  Harry walked toward him.  I must lie, he thought desperately . I must look and lie about what I see, that's all.  Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell's turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again.  He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket -- and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket. Somehow -- incredibly -- he'd gotten the Stone.  ""Well?"" said Quirrell impatiently. ""What do you see?""  Harry screwed up his courage.  ""I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,"" he invented. ""I -- I've won the house cup for Gryffindor.""  Quirrell cursed again.  ""Get out of the way,"" he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the Sorcerer's Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it?  But he hadn't walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn't moving his lips.  ""He lies... He lies...""  ""Potter, come back here!"" Quirrell shouted. ""Tell me the truth! What did you just see?""  The high voice spoke again.  ""Let me speak to him... face-to-face...""  ""Master, you are not strong enough!""  ""I have strength enough... for this...""  Harry felt as if Devil's Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn't move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell's head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the spot.  Harry would have screamed, but he couldn't make a sound. Where there should have been a back to Quirrell's head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.  ""Harry Potter... "" it whispered.  Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn't move.  ""See what I have become?"" the face said. ""Mere shadow and vapor... I have form only when I can share another's body... but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds... Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks... you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest... and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to create a body of my own... Now... why don't you give me that Stone in your pocket?""  So he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry's legs. He stumbled backward.  ""Don't be a fool,"" snarled the face. ""Better save your own life and join me... or you'll meet the same end as your parents... They died begging me for mercy...""  ""LIAR!"" Harry shouted suddenly.  Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see him. The evil face was now smiling.  ""How touching... "" it hissed. ""I always value bravery... Yes, boy, your parents were brave... I killed your father first; and he put up a courageous fight... but your mother needn't have died... she was trying to protect you... Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain.""  ""NEVER!""  Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed ""SEIZE HIM!"" and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell's hand close on his wrist. At once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry's scar; his head felt as though it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head lessened -- he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers -- they were blistering before his eyes.  ""Seize him! SEIZE HIM!"" shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet landing on top of him, both hands around Harry's neck -- Harry's scar was almost blinding him with pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony.  ""Master, I cannot hold him -- my hands -- my hands!""  And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms -- Harry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.  ""Then kill him, fool, and be done!"" screeched Voldemort.  Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell's face --  ""AAAARGH!""  Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn't touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain -- his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse.  Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off -- the pain in Harry's head was building -- he couldn't see -- he could only hear Quirrell's terrible shrieks and Voldemort's yells of, ""KILL HIM! KILL HIM!"" and other voices, maybe in Harry's own head, crying, ""Harry! Harry!""  He felt Quirrell's arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down... down... down...  Something gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too heavy.  He blinked. It wasn't the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How strange.  He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above him.  ""Good afternoon, Harry,"" said Dumbledore.  Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: ""Sir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! He's got the Stone! Sir, quick--""  ""Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,"" said Dumbledore. ""Quirrell does not have the Stone.""  ""Then who does? Sir, I--""  ""Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.""  Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.  ""Tokens from your friends and admirers,"" said Dumbledore, beaming. ""What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.""  ""How long have I been in here?""  ""Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried.""  ""But sir, the Stone--""  ""I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.""  ""You got there? You got Hermione's owl?""  ""We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you.""  ""It was you.""  ""I feared I might be too late.""  ""You nearly were, I couldn't have kept him off the Stone much longer -""  ""Not the Stone, boy, you -- the effort involved nearly killed you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed.""  ""Destroyed?"" said Harry blankly. ""But your friend -- Nicolas Flamel--""  ""Oh, you know about Nicolas?"" said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted. ""You did do the thing properly, didn't you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it's all for the best.""  ""But that means he and his wife will die, won't they?""  ""They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes, they will die.""  Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry's face.  ""To one as young as you, I'm sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above all -- the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.""  Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling.  ""Sir?"" said Harry. ""I've been thinking... sir -- even if the Stone's gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who--""  ""Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.""  ""Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort's going to try other ways of coming back, isn't he? I mean, he hasn't gone, has he?""  ""No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share... not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time -- and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power.""  Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then he said, ""Sir, there are some other things I'd like to know, if you can tell me... things I want to know the truth about...""  ""The truth."" Dumbledore sighed. ""It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you'll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.""  ""Well... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the first place?""  Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time.  ""Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not now. You will know, one day... put it from your mind for now, Harry. When you are older... I know you hate to hear this... when you are ready, you will know.""  And Harry knew it would be no good to argue.  ""But why couldn't Quirrell touch me?""  ""Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn't realize that love as powerful as your mother's for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign... to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.""  Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice again, Harry said, ""And the invisibility cloak -- do you know who sent it to me?""  ""Ah -- your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it."" Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. ""Useful things... your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.""  ""And there's something else...""  ""Fire away.""  ""Quirrell said Snape--""  ""Professor Snape, Harry.""  ""Yes, him -- Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father. Is that true?""  ""Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive.""  ""What?""  ""He saved his life.""  ""What ?""  ""Yes... "" said Dumbledore dreamily. ""Funny, the way people's minds work, isn't it? Professor Snape couldn't bear being in your father's debt... I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even. Then he could go back to hating your father's memory in peace...""  Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped.  ""And sir, there's one more thing...""  ""Just the one?""  ""How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?""  ""Ah, now, I'm glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that's saying something. You see, only one who wanted to find the Stone -- find it, but not use it -- would be able to get it, otherwise they'd just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My brain surprises even me sometimes... Now, enough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one, and since then I'm afraid I've rather lost my liking for them -- but I think I'll be safe with a nice toffee, don't you?""  He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then he choked and said, ""Alas! Ear wax!""  Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict.  ""Just five minutes,"" Harry pleaded.  ""Absolutely not.""  ""You let Professor Dumbledore in...""  ""Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need rest.""  ""I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam Pomfrey...""  ""Oh, very well,"" she said. ""But five minutes only.""  And she let Ron and Hermione in.  ""Harry!""  Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.  ""Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to -- Dumbledore was so worried--""  ""The whole school's talking about it,"" said Ron. ""What really happened?""  It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell's turban, Hermione screamed out loud.  ""So the Stone's gone?"" said Ron finally. ""Flamel's just going to die ?""  ""That's what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that -- what was it? -- 'to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.'""  ""I always said he was off his rocker,"" said Ron, looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was.  ""So what happened to you two?"" said Harry.  ""Well, I got back all right,"" said Hermione. ""I brought Ron round -- that took a while -- and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall -- he already knew -- he just said, 'Harry's gone after him, hasn't he?' and hurtled off to the third floor.""  ""D'you think he meant you to do it?"" said Ron. ""Sending you your father's cloak and everything?""  ""Well,"" Hermione exploded, ""if he did -- I mean to say that's terrible -- you could have been killed.""  ""No, it isn't,"" said Harry thoughtfully. ""He's a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don't think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It's almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could...""  ""Yeah, Dumbledore's off his rocker, all right,"" said Ron proudly. ""Listen, you've got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course -- you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you -- but the food'll be good.""  At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.  ""You've had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT"" she said firmly.  After a good night's sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal.  ""I want to go to the feast,"" he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes. ""I can, can't I?""  ""Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,"" she said stiffly, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn't realize how risky feasts could be. ""And you have another visitor.""  ""Oh, good,"" said Harry. ""Who is it?""  Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to Harry, took one look at him, and burst into tears.  ""It's -- all -- my -- ruddy -- fault!"" he sobbed, his face in his hands. I told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only thing he didn't know, an' I told him! Yeh could've died! All fer a dragon egg! I'll never drink again! I should be chucked out an' made ter live as a Muggle!""  ""Hagrid!"" said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. ""Hagrid, he'd have found out somehow, this is Voldemort we're talking about, he'd have found out even if you hadn't told him.""  ""Yeh could've died!"" sobbed Hagrid. ""An' don' say the name!""  ""VOLDEMORT!"" Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he stopped crying. ""I've met him and I'm calling him by his name. Please cheer up, Hagrid, we saved the Stone, it's gone, he can't use it. Have a Chocolate Frog, I've got loads...""  Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, ""That reminds me. I've got yeh a present.""  ""It's not a stoat sandwich, is it?"" said Harry anxiously, and at last Hagrid gave a weak chuckle.  ""Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it. 'course, he shoulda sacked me instead -- anyway, got yeh this...""  It seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. Harry opened it curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father.  ""Sent owls off ter all yer parents' old school friends, askin' fer photos... knew yeh didn' have any... d'yeh like it?""  Harry couldn't speak, but Hagrid understood.  Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night. He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey's fussing about, insisting on giving him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin's winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table.  When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him.  Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away.  ""Another year gone!"" Dumbledore said cheerfully. ""And I must trouble you with an old man's wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were... you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts...  ""Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy-two.""  A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a sickening sight.  ""Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin,"" said Dumbledore. ""However, recent events must be taken into account.""  The room went very still. The Slytherins' smiles faded a little.  ""Ahem,"" said Dumbledore. ""I have a few last-minute points to dish out. Let me see. Yes...  ""First -- to Mr. Ronald Weasley...""  Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.  ""... for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.""  Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, ""My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall's giant chess set!""  At last there was silence again.  ""Second -- to Miss Hermione Granger... for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.""  Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves -- they were a hundred points up.  ""Third -- to Mr. Harry Potter... "" said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet. ""... for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points.""  The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points -- exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup -- if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.  Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.  ""There are all kinds of courage,"" said Dumbledore, smiling. ""It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.""  Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn't have looked more stunned and horrified if he'd just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him.  ""Which means,"" Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, ""we need a little change of decoration.""  He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall's hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry's eye and Harry knew at once that Snape's feelings toward him hadn't changed one jot. This didn't worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.  It was the best evening of Harry's life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls... he would never, ever forget tonight.  Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn't have everything in life.  And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville's toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays (""I always hope they'll forget to give us these,"" said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King's Cross Station.  It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn't attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles.  ""You must come and stay this summer,"" said Ron, ""both of you -- I'll send you an owl.""  ""Thanks,"" said Harry, ""I'll need something to look forward to."" People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world. Some of them called:  ""Bye, Harry!""  ""See you, Potter!""  ""Still famous,"" said Ron, grinning at him.  ""Not where I'm going, I promise you,"" said Harry.  He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together. ""There he is, Mom, there he is, look!""  It was Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister, but she wasn't pointing at Ron.  ""Harry Potter!"" she squealed. ""Look, Mom! I can see--""  ""Be quiet, Ginny, and it's rude to point.""  Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them.  ""Busy year?"" she said.  ""Very,"" said Harry. ""Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. Weasley.""  ""Oh, it was nothing, dear.""  ""Ready, are you?""  It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry.  ""You must be Harry's family!"" said Mrs. Weasley.  ""In a manner of speaking,"" said Uncle Vernon. ""Hurry up, boy, we haven't got all day."" He walked away.  Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.  ""See you over the summer, then.""  ""Hope you have -- er -- a good holiday,"" said Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant.  ""Oh, I will,"" said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face. ""They don't know we're not allowed to use magic at home. I'm going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer..."
Percy Jackson 1 Chapter 1,"Look, I didn't want to be a half-blood. If you're reading this because you think you might be one, my advice is: close this book right  now. Believe whatever lie your mom or dad told you about your birth, and try to lead a normal  life. Being a half-blood is dangerous. It's scary. Most of the time, it gets you killed in painful,  nasty ways. If you're a normal kid, reading this because you think it's fiction, great. Read on. I envy you  for being able to believe that none of this ever happened. But if you recognize yourself in these pages—if you feel something stirring inside—stop  reading immediately. You might be one of us. And once you know that, it's only a matter of time  before they sense it too, and they'll come for you. Don't say I didn't warn you. My name is Percy Jackson. I'm twelve years old. Until a few months ago, I was a boarding student at Yancy Academy, a  private school for troubled kids in upstate New York. Am I a troubled kid? Yeah. You could say that. I could start at any point in my short miserable life to prove it, but things really started going  bad last May, when our sixth-grade class took a field trip to Manhattan— twenty-eight mental case kids and two teachers on a yellow school bus, heading to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to  look at ancient Greek and Roman stuff. I know—it sounds like torture. Most Yancy field trips were. But Mr. Brunner, our Latin teacher, was leading this trip, so I had hopes. Mr. Brunner was this middle-aged guy in a motorized wheelchair. He had thinning hair and a  scruffy beard and a frayed tweed jacket, which always smelled like coffee. You wouldn't think  he'd be cool, but he told stories and jokes and let us play games in class. He also had this  awesome collection of Roman armor and weapons, so he was the only teacher whose class didn't  put me to sleep. I hoped the trip would be okay. At least, I hoped that for once I wouldn't get in trouble. Boy, was I wrong. See, bad things happen to me on field trips. Like at my fifth-grade school, when we went to  the Saratoga battlefield, I had this accident with a Revolutionary War cannon. I wasn't aiming for  the school bus, but of course I got expelled anyway. And before that, at my fourth-grade school,  when we took a behind-the-scenes tour of the Marine World shark pool, I sort of hit the wrong  lever on the catwalk and our class took an unplanned swim. And the time before that... Well, you  get the idea. This trip, I was determined to be good. All the way into the city, I put up with Nancy Bobofit, the freckly, redheaded kleptomaniac  girl, hitting my best friend Grover in the back of the head with chunks of peanut butter-and ketchup sandwich. Grover was an easy target. He was scrawny. He cried when he got frustrated. He must've  been held back several grades, because he was the only sixth grader with acne and the start of a  wispy beard on his chin. On top of all that, he was crippled. He had a note excusing him from PE  for the rest of his life because he had some kind of muscular disease in his legs. He walked funny,  like every step hurt him, but don't let that fool you. You should've seen him run when it was  enchilada day in the cafeteria. Anyway, Nancy Bobofit was throwing wads of sandwich that stuck in his curly brown hair,  and she knew I couldn't do anything back to her because I was already on probation. The  headmaster had threatened me with death by in-school suspension if anything bad, embarrassing,  or even mildly entertaining happened on this trip. ""I'm going to kill her,"" I mumbled. Grover tried to calm me down. ""It's okay. I like peanut butter."" He dodged another piece of Nancy's lunch. ""That's it."" I started to get up, but Grover pulled me back to my seat. ""You're already on probation,"" he reminded me. ""You know who'll get blamed if anything  happens."" Looking back on it, I wish I'd decked Nancy Bobofit right then and there. In-school  suspension would've been nothing compared to the mess I was about to get myself into. Mr. Brunner led the museum tour. He rode up front in his wheelchair, guiding us through the big echoey galleries, past marble  statues and glass cases full of really old black-and-orange pottery. It blew my mind that this stuff had survived for two thousand, three thousand years. He gathered us around a thirteen-foot-tall stone column with a big sphinx on the top, and  started telling us how it was a grave marker, a stele, for a girl about our age. He told us about the  carvings on the sides. I was trying to listen to what he had to say, because it was kind of inter esting, but everybody around me was talking, and every time I told them to shut up, the other  teacher chaperone, Mrs. Dodds, would give me the evil eye. Mrs. Dodds was this little math teacher from Georgia who always wore a black leather jacket,  even though she was fifty years old. She looked mean enough to ride a Harley right into your locker. She had come to Yancy halfway through the year, when our last math teacher had a  nervous breakdown. From her first day, Mrs. Dodds loved Nancy Bobofit and figured I was devil spawn. She  would point her crooked finger at me and say, ""Now, honey,"" real sweet, and I knew I was going  to get after-school detention for a month. One time, after she'd made me erase answers out of old math workbooks until midnight, I told  Grover I didn't think Mrs. Dodds was human. He looked at me, real serious, and said, ""You're  absolutely right."" Mr. Brunner kept talking about Greek funeral art. Finally, Nancy Bobofit snickered something about the naked guy on the stele, and I turned  around and said, ""Will you shut up?"" It came out louder than I meant it to. The whole group laughed. Mr. Brunner stopped his story. ""Mr. Jackson,"" he said, ""did you have a comment?"" My face was totally red. I said, ""No, sir."" Mr. Brunner pointed to one of the pictures on the stele. ""Perhaps you'll tell us what this  picture represents?"" I looked at the carving, and felt a flush of relief, because I actually recognized it. ""That's  Kronos eating his kids, right?"" ""Yes,"" Mr. Brunner said, obviously not satisfied. ""And he did this because ..."" ""Well..."" I racked my brain to remember. ""Kronos was the king god, and—"" ""God?"" Mr. Brunner asked. ""Titan,"" I corrected myself. ""And ... he didn't trust his kids, who were the gods. So, um,  Kronos ate them, right? But his wife hid baby Zeus, and gave Kronos a rock to eat instead. And  later, when Zeus grew up, he tricked his dad, Kronos, into barfing up his brothers and sisters—"" ""Eeew!"" said one of the girls behind me. ""—and so there was this big fight between the gods and the Titans,"" I continued, ""and the  gods won."" Some snickers from the group. Behind me, Nancy Bobofit mumbled to a friend, ""Like we're going to use this in real life.  Like it's going to say on our job applications, 'Please explain why Kronos ate his kids.'"" ""And why, Mr. Jackson,"" Brunner said, ""to paraphrase Miss Bobofit's excellent question,  does this matter in real life?"" ""Busted,"" Grover muttered. ""Shut up,"" Nancy hissed, her face even brighter red than her hair. At least Nancy got packed, too. Mr. Brunner was the only one who ever caught her saying  anything wrong. He had radar ears. I thought about his question, and shrugged. ""I don't know, sir."" ""I see."" Mr. Brunner looked disappointed. ""Well, half credit, Mr. Jackson. Zeus did indeed  feed Kronos a mixture of mustard and wine, which made him disgorge his other five children,  who, of course, being immortal gods, had been living and growing up completely undigested in  the Titan's stomach. The gods defeated their father, sliced him to pieces with his own scythe, and  scattered his remains in Tartarus, the darkest part of the Underworld. On that happy note, it's time  for lunch. Mrs. Dodds, would you lead us back outside?"" The class drifted off, the girls holding their stomachs, the guys pushing each other around and  acting like doofuses. Grover and I were about to follow when Mr. Brunner said, ""Mr. Jackson."" I knew that was coming. I told Grover to keep going. Then I turned toward Mr. Brunner. ""Sir?"" Mr. Brunner had this look that wouldn't let you go— intense brown eyes that could've been a  thousand years old and had seen everything. ""You must learn the answer to my question,"" Mr. Brunner told me. ""About the Titans?"" ""About real life. And how your studies apply to it."" ""Oh."" ""What you learn from me,"" he said, ""is vitally important. I expect you to treat it as such. I will  accept only the best from you, Percy Jackson."" I wanted to get angry, this guy pushed me so hard. I mean, sure, it was kind of cool on tournament days, when he dressed up in a suit of Roman  armor and shouted: ""What ho!'"" and challenged us, sword-point against chalk, to run to the board  and name every Greek and Roman person who had ever lived, and their mother, and what god  they worshipped. But Mr. Brunner expected me to be as good as everybody else, despite the fact  that I have dyslexia and attention deficit disorder and I had never made above a C— in my life.  No—he didn't expect me to be as good; he expected me to be better. And I just couldn't learn all  those names and facts, much less spell them correctly. I mumbled something about trying harder, while Mr. Brunner took one long sad look at the  stele, like he'd been at this girl's funeral. He told me to go outside and eat my lunch. The class gathered on the front steps of the museum, where we could watch the foot traffic along  Fifth Avenue. Overhead, a huge storm was brewing, with clouds blacker than I'd ever seen over the city. I  figured maybe it was global warming or something, because the weather all across New York  state had been weird since Christmas. We'd had massive snow storms, flooding, wildfires from  lightning strikes. I wouldn't have been surprised if this was a hurricane blowing in. Nobody else seemed to notice. Some of the guys were pelting pigeons with Lunchables  crackers. Nancy Bobofit was trying to pickpocket something from a lady's purse, and, of course,  Mrs. Dodds wasn't seeing a thing. Grover and I sat on the edge of the fountain, away from the others. We thought that maybe if  we did that, everybody wouldn't know we were from that school—the school for loser freaks who  couldn't make it elsewhere. ""Detention?"" Grover asked. ""Nah,"" I said. ""Not from Brunner. I just wish he'd lay off me sometimes. I mean—I'm not a  genius."" Grover didn't say anything for a while. Then, when I thought he was going to give me some  deep philosophical comment to make me feel better, he said, ""Can I have your apple?"" I didn't have much of an appetite, so I let him take it. I watched the stream of cabs going down Fifth Avenue, and thought about my mom's  apartment, only a little ways uptown from where we sat. I hadn't seen her since Christmas. I  wanted so bad to jump in a taxi and head home. She'd hug me and be glad to see me, but she'd be  disappointed, too. She'd send me right back to Yancy, remind me that I had to try harder, even if  this was my sixth school in six years and I was probably going to be kicked out again. I wouldn't  be able to stand that sad look she'd give me. Mr. Brunner parked his wheelchair at the base of the handicapped ramp. He ate celery while  he read a paperback novel. A red umbrella stuck up from the back of his chair, making it look like  a motorized cafe table. I was about to unwrap my sandwich when Nancy Bobofit appeared in front of me with her  ugly friends—I guess she'd gotten tired of stealing from the tourists—and dumped her half-eaten  lunch in Grover's lap. ""Oops."" She grinned at me with her crooked teeth. Her freckles were orange, as if somebody  had spray-painted her face with liquid Cheetos. I tried to stay cool. The school counselor had told me a million times, ""Count to ten, get  control of your temper."" But I was so mad my mind went blank. A wave roared in my ears. I don't remember touching her, but the next thing I knew, Nancy was sitting on her butt in the  fountain, screaming, ""Percy pushed me!"" Mrs. Dodds materialized next to us. Some of the kids were whispering: ""Did you see—"" ""—the water—"" ""—like it grabbed her—"" I didn't know what they were talking about. All I knew was that I was in trouble again. As soon as Mrs. Dodds was sure poor little Nancy was okay, promising to get her a new shirt  at the museum gift shop, etc., etc., Mrs. Dodds turned on me. There was a triumphant fire in her  eyes, as if I'd done something she'd been waiting for all semester. ""Now, honey—"" ""I know,"" I grumbled. ""A month erasing workbooks."" That wasn't the right thing to say. ""Come with me,"" Mrs. Dodds said. ""Wait!"" Grover yelped. ""It was me. I pushed her."" I stared at him, stunned. I couldn't believe he was trying to cover for me. Mrs. Dodds scared  Grover to death. She glared at him so hard his whiskery chin trembled. ""I don't think so, Mr. Underwood,"" she said. ""But—"" ""You—will—stay—here."" Grover looked at me desperately. ""It's okay, man,"" I told him. ""Thanks for trying."" ""Honey,"" Mrs. Dodds barked at me. ""Now."" Nancy Bobofit smirked. I gave her my deluxe I'll-kill-you-later stare. Then I turned to face Mrs. Dodds, but she wasn't  there. She was standing at the museum entrance, way at the top of the steps, gesturing impatiently  at me to come on. How'd she get there so fast? I have moments like that a lot, when my brain falls asleep or something, and the next thing I  know I've missed something, as if a puzzle piece fell out of the universe and left me staring at the  blank place behind it. The school counselor told me this was part of the ADHD, my brain  misinterpreting things. I wasn't so sure. I went after Mrs. Dodds. Halfway up the steps, I glanced back at Grover. He was looking pale, cutting his eyes  between me and Mr. Brunner, like he wanted Mr. Brunner to notice what was going on, but Mr.  Brunner was absorbed in his novel. I looked back up. Mrs. Dodds had disappeared again. She was now inside the building, at the  end of the entrance hall.  Okay, I thought. She's going to make me buy a new shirt for Nancy at the gift shop. But apparently that wasn't the plan. I followed her deeper into the museum. When I finally caught up to her, we were back in the  Greek and Roman section. Except for us, the gallery was empty. Mrs. Dodds stood with her arms crossed in front of a big marble frieze of the Greek gods. She  was making this weird noise in her throat, like growling. Even without the noise, I would've been nervous. It's weird being alone with a teacher,  especially Mrs. Dodds. Something about the way she looked at the frieze, as if she wanted to  pulverize it... ""You've been giving us problems, honey,"" she said. I did the safe thing. I said, ""Yes, ma'am."" She tugged on the cuffs of her leather jacket. ""Did you really think you would get away with  it?"" The look in her eyes was beyond mad. It was evil. She's a teacher, I thought nervously. It's not like she's going to hurt me. I said, ""I'll—I'll try harder, ma'am."" Thunder shook the building. ""We are not fools, Percy Jackson,"" Mrs. Dodds said. ""It was only a matter of time before we  found you out. Confess, and you will suffer less pain."" I didn't know what she was talking about. All I could think of was that the teachers must've found the illegal stash of candy I'd been  selling out of my dorm room. Or maybe they'd realized I got my essay on Tom Sawyer from the  Internet without ever reading the book and now they were going to take away my grade. Or  worse, they were going to make me read the book. ""Well?"" she demanded. ""Ma'am, I don't..."" ""Your time is up,"" she hissed. Then the weirdest thing happened. Her eyes began to glow like barbecue coals. Her fingers  stretched, turning into talons. Her jacket melted into large, leathery wings. She wasn't human. She  was a shriveled hag with bat wings and claws and a mouth full of yellow fangs, and she was  about to slice me to ribbons. Then things got even stranger. Mr. Brunner, who'd been out in front of the museum a minute before, wheeled his chair into  the doorway of the gallery, holding a pen in his hand. ""What ho, Percy!"" he shouted, and tossed the pen through the air. Mrs. Dodds lunged at me. With a yelp, I dodged and felt talons slash the air next to my ear. I snatched the ballpoint pen  out of the air, but when it hit my hand, it wasn't a pen anymore. It was a sword—Mr. Brunner's  bronze sword, which he always used on tournament day. Mrs. Dodds spun toward me with a murderous look in her eyes. My knees were jelly. My hands were shaking so bad I almost dropped the sword. She snarled, ""Die, honey!"" And she flew straight at me. Absolute terror ran through my body. I did the only thing that came naturally: I swung the  sword. The metal blade hit her shoulder and passed clean through her body as if she were made of  water. Hisss! Mrs. Dodds was a sand castle in a power fan. She exploded into yellow powder, vaporized on  the spot, leaving nothing but the smell of sulfur and a dying screech and a chill of evil in the air,  as if those two glowing red eyes were still watching me. I was alone. There was a ballpoint pen in my hand. Mr. Brunner wasn't there. Nobody was there but me. My hands were still trembling. My lunch must've been contaminated with magic mushrooms  or something. Had I imagined the whole thing? I went back outside. It had started to rain. Grover was sitting by the fountain, a museum map tented over his head. Nancy Bobofit was  still standing there, soaked from her swim in the fountain, grumbling to her ugly friends. When  she saw me, she said, ""I hope Mrs. Kerr whipped your butt."" I said, ""Who?"" ""Our teacher. Duh!"" I blinked. We had no teacher named Mrs. Kerr. I asked Nancy what she was talking about. She just rolled her eyes and turned away. I asked Grover where Mrs. Dodds was. He said, ""Who?"" But he paused first, and he wouldn't look at me, so I thought he was messing with me. ""Not funny, man,"" I told him. ""This is serious."" Thunder boomed overhead. I saw Mr. Brunner sitting under his red umbrella, reading his book, as if he'd never moved. I went over to him. He looked up, a little distracted. ""Ah, that would be my pen. Please bring your own writing  utensil in the future, Mr. Jackson."" I handed Mr. Brunner his pen. I hadn't even realized I was still holding it. ""Sir,"" I said, ""where's Mrs. Dodds?"" He stared at me blankly. ""Who?"" ""The other chaperone. Mrs. Dodds. The pre-algebra teacher."" He frowned and sat forward, looking mildly concerned. ""Percy, there is no Mrs. Dodds on  this trip. As far as I know, there has never been a Mrs. Dodds at Yancy Academy. Are you feeling  all right?""  "
Percy Jackson 1 Chapter 2,"I was used to the occasional weird experience, but usually they were over quickly. This twenty four/seven hallucination was more than I could handle. For the rest of the school year, the entire  campus seemed to be playing some kind of trick on me. The students acted as if they were  completely and totally convinced that Mrs. Kerr—a perky blond woman whom I'd never seen in  my life until she got on our bus at the end of the field trip—had been our pre-algebra teacher  since Christmas. Every so often I would spring a Mrs. Dodds reference on somebody, just to see if I could trip  them up, but they would stare at me like I was psycho. It got so I almost believed them—Mrs. Dodds had never existed. Almost. But Grover couldn't fool me. When I mentioned the name Dodds to him, he would hesitate,  then claim she didn't exist. But I knew he was lying. Something was going on. Something had happened at the museum. I didn't have much time to think about it during the days, but at night, visions of Mrs. Dodds  with talons and leathery wings would wake me up in a cold sweat. The freak weather continued, which didn't help my mood. One night, a thunderstorm blew  out the windows in my dorm room. A few days later, the biggest tornado ever spotted in the  Hudson Valley touched down only fifty miles from Yancy Academy. One of the current events  we studied in social studies class was the unusual number of small planes that had gone down in  sudden squalls in the Atlantic that year. I started feeling cranky and irritable most of the time. My grades slipped from Ds to Fs. I got  into more fights with Nancy Bobofit and her friends. I was sent out into the hallway in almost  every class. Finally, when our English teacher, Mr. Nicoll, asked me for the millionth time why I was too  lazy to study for spelling tests, I snapped. I called him an old sot. I wasn't even sure what it  meant, but it sounded good. The headmaster sent my mom a letter the following week, making it official: I would not be  invited back next year to Yancy Academy. Fine, I told myself. Just fine. I was homesick. I wanted to be with my mom in our little apartment on the Upper East Side, even if I had to  go to public school and put up with my obnoxious stepfather and his stupid poker parties. And yet... there were things I'd miss at Yancy. The view of the woods out my dorm window,  the Hudson River in the distance, the smell of pine trees. I'd miss Grover, who'd been a good  friend, even if he was a little strange. I worried how he'd survive next year without me. I'd miss Latin class, too—Mr. Brunner's crazy tournament days and his faith that I could do  well. As exam week got closer, Latin was the only test I studied for. I hadn't forgotten what Mr.  Brunner had told me about this subject being life-and-death for me. I wasn't sure why, but I'd  started to believe him. The evening before my final, I got so frustrated I threw the Cambridge Guide to Greek Mythology  across my dorm room. Words had started swimming off the page, circling my head, the letters  doing one-eighties as if they were riding skateboards. There was no way I was going to remember  the difference between Chiron and Charon, or Polydictes and Polydeuces. And conjugating those  Latin verbs? Forget it. I paced the room, feeling like ants were crawling around inside my shirt. I remembered Mr. Brunner's serious expression, his thousand-year-old eyes. I will accept only  the best from you, Percy Jackson. I took a deep breath. I picked up the mythology book. I'd never asked a teacher for help before. Maybe if I talked to Mr. Brunner, he could give me  some pointers. At least I could apologize for the big fat F I was about to score on his exam. I  didn't want to leave Yancy Academy with him thinking I hadn't tried. I walked downstairs to the faculty offices. Most of them were dark and empty, but Mr.  Brunner's door was ajar, light from his window stretching across the hallway floor. I was three steps from the door handle when I heard voices inside the office. Mr. Brunner  asked a question. A voice that was definitely Grover's said ""... worried about Percy, sir."" I froze. I'm not usually an eavesdropper, but I dare you to try not listening if you hear your best friend  talking about you to an adult. I inched closer. ""... alone this summer,"" Grover was saying. ""I mean, a Kindly One in the school! Now that  we know for sure, and they know too—"" ""We would only make matters worse by rushing him,"" Mr. Brunner said. ""We need the boy  to mature more."" ""But he may not have time. The summer solstice deadline— "" ""Will have to be resolved without him, Grover. Let him enjoy his ignorance while he still  can."" ""Sir, he saw her... ."" ""His imagination,"" Mr. Brunner insisted. ""The Mist over the students and staff will be enough  to convince him of that."" ""Sir, I ... I can't fail in my duties again."" Grover's voice was choked with emotion. ""You  know what that would mean."" ""You haven't failed, Grover,"" Mr. Brunner said kindly. ""I should have seen her for what she  was. Now let's just worry about keeping Percy alive until next fall—"" The mythology book dropped out of my hand and hit the floor with a thud. Mr. Brunner went silent. My heart hammering, I picked up the book and backed down the hall. A shadow slid across the lighted glass of Brunner's office door, the shadow of something  much taller than my wheelchair-bound teacher, holding something that looked suspiciously like  an archer's bow. I opened the nearest door and slipped inside. A few seconds later I heard a slow clop-clop-clop, like muffled wood blocks, then a sound like  an animal snuffling right outside my door. A large, dark shape paused in front of the glass, then  moved on. A bead of sweat trickled down my neck. Somewhere in the hallway, Mr. Brunner spoke. ""Nothing,"" he murmured. ""My nerves haven't  been right since the winter solstice."" ""Mine neither,"" Grover said. ""But I could have sworn ..."" ""Go back to the dorm,"" Mr. Brunner told him. ""You've got a long day of exams tomorrow."" ""Don't remind me."" The lights went out in Mr. Brunner's office. I waited in the dark for what seemed like forever. Finally, I slipped out into the hallway and made my way back up to the dorm. Grover was lying on his bed, studying his Latin exam notes like he'd been there all night. ""Hey,"" he said, bleary-eyed. ""You going to be ready for this test?"" I didn't answer. ""You look awful."" He frowned. ""Is everything okay?"" ""Just... tired."" I turned so he couldn't read my expression, and started getting ready for bed. I didn't understand what I'd heard downstairs. I wanted to believe I'd imagined the whole  thing. But one thing was clear: Grover and Mr. Brunner were talking about me behind my back.  They thought I was in some kind of danger. The next afternoon, as I was leaving the three-hour Latin exam, my eyes swimming with all the  Greek and Roman names I'd misspelled, Mr. Brunner called me back inside. For a moment, I was worried he'd found out about my eavesdropping the night before, but  that didn't seem to be the problem. ""Percy,"" he said. ""Don't be discouraged about leaving Yancy. It's ... it's for the best."" His tone was kind, but the words still embarrassed me. Even though he was speaking quietly,  the other kids finishing the test could hear. Nancy Bobofit smirked at me and made sarcastic little  kissing motions with her lips. I mumbled, ""Okay, sir."" ""I mean ..."" Mr. Brunner wheeled his chair back and forth, like he wasn't sure what to say.  ""This isn't the right place for you. It was only a matter of time."" My eyes stung. Here was my favorite teacher, in front of the class, telling me I couldn't handle it. After  saying he believed in me all year, now he was telling me I was destined to get kicked out. ""Right,"" I said, trembling. ""No, no,"" Mr. Brunner said. ""Oh, confound it all. What I'm trying to say ... you're not normal,  Percy. That's nothing to be—"" ""Thanks,"" I blurted. ""Thanks a lot, sir, for reminding me. ""Percy—"" But I was already gone. On the last day of the term, I shoved my clothes into my suitcase. The other guys were joking around, talking about their vacation plans. One of them was  going on a hiking trip to Switzerland. Another was cruising the Caribbean for a month. They  were juvenile delinquents, like me, but they were rich juvenile delinquents. Their daddies were  executives, or ambassadors, or celebrities. I was a nobody, from a family of nobodies. They asked me what I'd be doing this summer and I told them I was going back to the city. What I didn't tell them was that I'd have to get a summer job walking dogs or selling  magazine subscriptions, and spend my free time worrying about where I'd go to school in the fall. ""Oh,"" one of the guys said. ""That's cool."" They went back to their conversation as if I'd never existed. The only person I dreaded saying good-bye to was Grover, but as it turned out, I didn't have  to. He'd booked a ticket to Manhattan on the same Greyhound as I had, so there we were, together  again, heading into the city. During the whole bus ride, Grover kept glancing nervously down the aisle, watching the other  passengers. It occurred to me that he'd always acted nervous and fidgety when we left Yancy, as  if he expected something bad to happen. Before, I'd always assumed he was worried about getting  teased. But there was nobody to tease him on the Greyhound. Finally I couldn't stand it anymore. I said, ""Looking for Kindly Ones?"" Grover nearly jumped out of his seat. ""Wha—what do you mean?"" I confessed about eavesdropping on him and Mr. Brunner the night before the exam. Grover's eye twitched. ""How much did you hear?"" ""Oh ... not much. What's the summer solstice dead-line?"" He winced. ""Look, Percy ... I was just worried for you, see? I mean, hallucinating about  demon math teachers ..."" ""Grover—"" ""And I was telling Mr. Brunner that maybe you were overstressed or something, because there  was no such person as Mrs. Dodds, and ..."" ""Grover, you're a really, really bad liar."" His ears turned pink. From his shirt pocket, he fished out a grubby business card. ""Just take this, okay? In case you  need me this summer. The card was in fancy script, which was murder on my dyslexic eyes, but I finally made out  something like: Grover Underwood Keeper Half-Blood Hill Long Island, New York  (800) 009-0009   ""What's Half—""  ""Don't say it aloud!"" he yelped. ""That's my, um ... summer address."" My heart sank. Grover had a summer home. I'd never considered that his family might be as  rich as the others at Yancy. ""Okay,"" I said glumly. ""So, like, if I want to come visit your mansion."" He nodded. ""Or ... or if you need me."" ""Why would I need you?"" It came out harsher than I meant it to. Grover blushed right down to his Adam's apple. ""Look, Percy, the truth is, I—I kind of have  to protect you."" I stared at him. All year long, I'd gotten in fights, keeping bullies away from him. I'd lost sleep worrying that  he'd get beaten up next year without me. And here he was acting like he was the one who  defended me. ""Grover,"" I said, ""what exactly are you protecting me from?"" There was a huge grinding noise under our feet. Black smoke poured from the dashboard and  the whole bus filled with a smell like rotten eggs. The driver cursed and limped the Greyhound  over to the side of the highway. After a few minutes clanking around in the engine compartment, the driver announced that  we'd all have to get off. Grover and I filed outside with everybody else. We were on a stretch of country road—no place you'd notice if you didn't break down there.  On our side of the highway was nothing but maple trees and litter from passing cars. On the other  side, across four lanes of asphalt shimmering with afternoon heat, was an old-fashioned fruit  stand. The stuff on sale looked really good: heaping boxes of bloodred cherries and apples, walnuts  and apricots, jugs of cider in a claw-foot tub full of ice. There were no customers, just three old  ladies sitting in rocking chairs in the shade of a maple tree, knitting the biggest pair of socks I'd  ever seen. I mean these socks were the size of sweaters, but they were clearly socks. The lady on the  right knitted one of them. The lady on the left knitted the other. The lady in the middle held an  enormous basket of electric-blue yarn. All three women looked ancient, with pale faces wrinkled like fruit leather, silver hair tied  back in white bandannas, bony arms sticking out of bleached cotton dresses. The weirdest thing was, they seemed to be looking right at me. I looked over at Grover to say something about this and saw that the blood had drained from  his face. His nose was twitching. ""Grover?"" I said. ""Hey, man—"" ""Tell me they're not looking at you. They are, aren't they?"" ""Yeah. Weird, huh? You think those socks would fit me?"" ""Not funny, Percy. Not funny at all."" The old lady in the middle took out a huge pair of scissors—gold and silver, long-bladed, like  shears. I heard Grover catch his breath. ""We're getting on the bus,"" he told me. ""Come on."" ""What?"" I said. ""It's a thousand degrees in there."" ""Come on!'"" He pried open the door and climbed inside, but I stayed back. Across the road, the old ladies were still watching me. The middle one cut the yarn, and I  swear I could hear that snip across four lanes of traffic. Her two friends balled up the electric-blue  socks, leaving me wondering who they could possibly be for—Sasquatch or Godzilla. At the rear of the bus, the driver wrenched a big chunk of smoking metal out of the engine  compartment. The bus shuddered, and the engine roared back to life. The passengers cheered. ""Darn right!"" yelled the driver. He slapped the bus with his hat. ""Everybody back on board!"" Once we got going, I started feeling feverish, as if I'd caught the flu. Grover didn't look much better. He was shivering and his teeth were chattering. ""Grover?"" ""Yeah?"" ""What are you not telling me?"" He dabbed his forehead with his shirt sleeve. ""Percy, what did you see back at the fruit  stand?"" ""You mean the old ladies? What is it about them, man? They're not like ... Mrs. Dodds, are  they?"" His expression was hard to read, but I got the feeling that the fruit-stand ladies were  something much, much worse than Mrs. Dodds. He said, ""Just tell me what you saw.""  ""The middle one took out her scissors, and she cut the yarn."" He closed his eyes and made a gesture with his fingers that might've been crossing himself,  but it wasn't. It was something else, something almost—older. He said, ""You saw her snip the cord."" ""Yeah. So?"" But even as I said it, I knew it was a big deal. ""This is not happening,"" Grover mumbled. He started chewing at his thumb. ""I don't want this  to be like the last time."" ""What last time?"" ""Always sixth grade. They never get past sixth."" ""Grover,"" I said, because he was really starting to scare me. ""What are you talking about?"" ""Let me walk you home from the bus station. Promise me."" This seemed like a strange request to me, but I promised he could. ""Is this like a superstition or something?"" I asked. No answer. ""Grover—that snipping of the yarn. Does that mean somebody is going to die?"" He looked at me mournfully, like he was already picking the kind of flowers I'd like best on  my coffin."
Percy Jackson 1 Chapter 3,"Confession time: I ditched Grover as soon as we got to the bus terminal. I know, I know. It was rude. But Grover was freaking me out, looking at me like I was a dead  man, muttering ""Why does this always happen?"" and ""Why does it always have to he sixth  grade?"" Whenever he got upset, Grover's bladder acted up, so I wasn't surprised when, as soon as we  got off the bus, he made me promise to wait for him, then made a beeline for the restroom.  Instead of waiting, I got my suitcase, slipped outside, and caught the first taxi uptown. ""East One-hundred-and-fourth and First,"" I told the driver. A word about my mother, before you meet her. Her name is Sally Jackson and she's the best person in the world, which just proves my theory  that the best people have the rottenest luck. Her own parents died in a plane crash when she was  five, and she was raised by an uncle who didn't care much about her. She wanted to be a novelist,  so she spent high school working to save enough money for a college with a good creative writing program. Then her uncle got cancer, and she had to quit school her senior year to take  care of him. After he died, she was left with no money, no family, and no diploma. The only good break she ever got was meeting my dad. I don't have any memories of him, just this sort of warm glow, maybe the barest trace of his  smile. My mom doesn't like to talk about him because it makes her sad. She has no pictures. See, they weren't married. She told me he was rich and important, and their relationship was a  secret. Then one day, he set sail across the Atlantic on some important journey, and he never  came back. Lost at sea, my mom told me. Not dead. Lost at sea. She worked odd jobs, took night classes to get her high school diploma, and raised me on her  own. She never complained or got mad. Not even once. But I knew I wasn't an easy kid. Finally, she married Gabe Ugliano, who was nice the first thirty seconds we knew him, then  showed his true colors as a world-class jerk. When I was young, I nicknamed him Smelly Gabe.  I'm sorry, but it's the truth. The guy reeked like moldy garlic pizza wrapped in gym shorts. Between the two of us, we made my mom's life pretty hard. The way Smelly Gabe treated  her, the way he and I got along ... well, when I came home is a good example. I walked into our little apartment, hoping my mom would be home from work. Instead, Smelly  Gabe was in the living room, playing poker with his buddies. The television blared ESPN. Chips  and beer cans were strewn all over the carpet. Hardly looking up, he said around his cigar, ""So, you're home."" ""Where's my mom?"" ""Working,"" he said. ""You got any cash?"" That was it. No Welcome back. Good to see you. How has your life been the last six months? Gabe had put on weight. He looked like a tuskless walrus in thrift-store clothes. He had about  three hairs on his head, all combed over his bald scalp, as if that made him handsome or  something. He managed the Electronics Mega-Mart in Queens, but he stayed home most of the time. I  don't know why he hadn't been fired long before. He just kept on collecting paychecks, spending  the money on cigars that made me nauseous, and on beer, of course. Always beer. Whenever I  was home, he expected me to provide his gambling funds. He called that our ""guy secret.""  Meaning, if I told my mom, he would punch my lights out. ""I don't have any cash,"" I told him. He raised a greasy eyebrow. Gabe could sniff out money like a bloodhound, which was surprising, since his own smell  should've covered up everything else. ""You took a taxi from the bus station,"" he said. Probably paid with a twenty. Got six, seven  bucks in change. Somebody expects to live under this roof, he ought to carry his own weight. Am  I right, Eddie?"" Eddie, the super of the apartment building, looked at me with a twinge of sympathy. ""Come  on, Gabe,"" he said. ""The kid just got here."" ""Am I right?"" Gabe repeated. Eddie scowled into his bowl of pretzels. The other two guys passed gas in harmony. ""Fine,"" I said. I dug a wad of dollars out of my pocket and threw the money on the table. ""I  hope you lose."" ""Your report card came, brain boy!"" he shouted after me. ""I wouldn't act so snooty!"" I slammed the door to my room, which really wasn't my room. During school months, it was  Gabe's ""study."" He didn't study anything in there except old car magazines, but he loved shoving  my stuff in the closet, leaving his muddy boots on my windowsill, and doing his best to make the  place smell like his nasty cologne and cigars and stale beer. I dropped my suitcase on the bed. Home sweet home. Gabe's smell was almost worse than the nightmares about Mrs. Dodds, or the sound of that  old fruit lady's shears snipping the yarn. But as soon as I thought that, my legs felt weak. I remembered Grover's look of panic—how  he'd made me promise I wouldn't go home without him. A sudden chill rolled through me. I felt  like someone—something—was looking for me right now, maybe pounding its way up the stairs,  growing long, horrible talons. Then I heard my mom's voice. ""Percy?"" She opened the bedroom door, and my fears melted. My mother can make me feel good just by walking into the room. Her eyes sparkle and  change color in the light. Her smile is as warm as a quilt. She's got a few gray streaks mixed in  with her long brown hair, but I never think of her as old. When she looks at me, it's like she's  seeing all the good things about me, none of the bad. I've never heard her raise her voice or say an  unkind word to anyone, not even me or Gabe. ""Oh, Percy."" She hugged me tight. ""I can't believe it. You've grown since Christmas!"" Her red-white-and-blue Sweet on America uniform smelled like the best things in the world:  chocolate, licorice, and all the other stuff she sold at the candy shop in Grand Central. She'd  brought me a huge bag of ""free samples,"" the way she always did when I came home. We sat together on the edge of the bed. While I attacked the blueberry sour strings, she ran  her hand through my hair and demanded to know everything I hadn't put in my letters. She didn't  mention anything about my getting expelled. She didn't seem to care about that. But was I okay?  Was her little boy doing all right? I told her she was smothering me, and to lay off and all that, but secretly, I was really, really  glad to see her. From the other room, Gabe yelled, ""Hey, Sally—how about some bean dip, huh?"" I gritted my teeth. My mom is the nicest lady in the world. She should've been married to a millionaire, not to  some jerk like Gabe. For her sake, I tried to sound upbeat about my last days at Yancy Academy. I told her I wasn't  too down about the expulsion. I'd lasted almost the whole year this time. I'd made some new  friends. I'd done pretty well in Latin. And honestly, the fights hadn't been as bad as the  headmaster said. I liked Yancy Academy. I really did. I put such a good spin on the year, I almost  convinced myself. I started choking up, thinking about Grover and Mr. Brunner. Even Nancy  Bobofit suddenly didn't seem so bad. Until that trip to the museum ... ""What?"" my mom asked. Her eyes tugged at my conscience, trying to pull out the secrets.  ""Did something scare you?"" ""No, Mom."" I felt bad lying. I wanted to tell her about Mrs. Dodds and the three old ladies with the yarn,  but I thought it would sound stupid. She pursed her lips. She knew I was holding back, but she didn't push me. ""I have a surprise for you,"" she said. ""We're going to the beach."" My eyes widened. ""Montauk?"" ""Three nights—same cabin."" ""When?"" She smiled. ""As soon as I get changed."" I couldn't believe it. My mom and I hadn't been to Montauk the last two summers, because  Gabe said there wasn't enough money. Gabe appeared in the doorway and growled, ""Bean dip, Sally? Didn't you hear me?"" I wanted to punch him, but I met my mom's eyes and I understood she was offering me a  deal: be nice to Gabe for a little while. Just until she was ready to leave for Montauk. Then we  would get out of here. ""I was on my way, honey,"" she told Gabe. ""We were just talking about the trip."" Gabe's eyes got small. ""The trip? You mean you were serious about that?"" ""I knew it,"" I muttered. ""He won't let us go."" ""Of course he will,"" my mom said evenly. ""Your stepfather is just worried about money.  That's all. Besides,"" she added, ""Gabriel won't have to settle for bean dip. I'll make him enough  seven-layer dip for the whole weekend. Guacamole. Sour cream. The works."" Gabe softened a bit. ""So this money for your trip ... it comes out of your clothes budget,  right?"" ""Yes, honey,"" my mother said. ""And you won't take my car anywhere but there and back."" ""We'll be very careful."" Gabe scratched his double chin. ""Maybe if you hurry with that seven-layer dip ... And maybe  if the kid apologizes for interrupting my poker game."" Maybe if I kick you in your soft spot, I thought. And make you sing soprano for a week. But my mom's eyes warned me not to make him mad. Why did she put up with this guy? I wanted to scream. Why did she care what he thought? ""I'm sorry,"" I muttered. ""I'm really sorry I interrupted your incredibly important poker game.  Please go back to it right now."" Gabe's eyes narrowed. His tiny brain was probably trying to detect sarcasm in my statement. ""Yeah, whatever,"" he decided. He went back to his game. ""Thank you, Percy,"" my mom said. ""Once we get to Montauk, we'll talk more about...  whatever you've forgotten to tell me, okay?"" For a moment, I thought I saw anxiety in her eyes—the same fear I'd seen in Grover during  the bus ride—as if my mom too felt an odd chill in the air. But then her smile returned, and I figured I must have been mistaken. She ruffled my hair and  went to make Gabe his seven-layer dip. An hour later we were ready to leave. Gabe took a break from his poker game long enough to watch me lug my mom's bags to the  car. He kept griping and groaning about losing her cooking—and more important, his '78  Camaro—for the whole weekend. ""Not a scratch on this car, brain boy,"" he warned me as I loaded the last bag. ""Not one little  scratch."" Like I'd be the one driving. I was twelve. But that didn't matter to Gabe. If a seagull so much  as pooped on his paint job, he'd find a way to blame me. Watching him lumber back toward the apartment building, I got so mad I did something I  can't explain. As Gabe reached the doorway, I made the hand gesture I'd seen Grover make on the  bus, a sort of warding-off-evil gesture, a clawed hand over my heart, then a shoving movement toward Gabe. The screen door slammed shut so hard it whacked him in the butt and sent him  flying up the staircase as if he'd been shot from a cannon. Maybe it was just the wind, or some  freak accident with the hinges, but I didn't stay long enough to find out. I got in the Camaro and told my mom to step on it. Our rental cabin was on the south shore, way out at the tip of Long Island. It was a little pastel  box with faded curtains, half sunken into the dunes. There was always sand in the sheets and  spiders in the cabinets, and most of the time the sea was too cold to swim in. I loved the place. We'd been going there since I was a baby. My mom had been going even longer. She never  exactly said, but I knew why the beach was special to her. It was the place where she'd met my  dad. As we got closer to Montauk, she seemed to grow younger, years of worry and work  disappearing from her face. Her eyes turned the color of the sea. We got there at sunset, opened all the cabin's windows, and went through our usual cleaning  routine. We walked on the beach, fed blue corn chips to the seagulls, and munched on blue jelly  beans, blue saltwater taffy, and all the other free samples my mom had brought from work. I guess I should explain the blue food. See, Gabe had once told my mom there was no such thing. They had this fight, which seemed  like a really small thing at the time. But ever since, my mom went out of her way to eat blue. She  baked blue birthday cakes. She mixed blueberry smoothies. She bought blue-corn tortilla chips  and brought home blue candy from the shop. This—along with keeping her maiden name,  Jackson, rather than calling herself Mrs. Ugliano—was proof that she wasn't totally suckered by  Gabe. She did have a rebellious streak, like me. When it got dark, we made a fire. We roasted hot dogs and marshmallows. Mom told me  stories about when she was a kid, back before her parents died in the plane crash. She told me  about the books she wanted to write someday, when she had enough money to quit the candy  shop. Eventually, I got up the nerve to ask about what was always on my mind whenever we came  to Montauk—my father. Mom's eyes went all misty. I figured she would tell me the same things  she always did, but I never got tired of hearing them. ""He was kind, Percy,"" she said. ""Tall, handsome, and powerful. But gentle, too. You have his  black hair, you know, and his green eyes."" Mom fished a blue jelly bean out of her candy bag. ""I wish he could see you, Percy. He  would be so proud."" I wondered how she could say that. What was so great about me? A dyslexic, hyperactive boy  with a D+ report card, kicked out of school for the sixth time in six years. ""How old was I?"" I asked. ""I mean ... when he left?"" She watched the flames. ""He was only with me for one summer, Percy. Right here at this  beach. This cabin."" ""But... he knew me as a baby."" ""No, honey. He knew I was expecting a baby, but he never saw you. He had to leave before  you were born."" I tried to square that with the fact that I seemed to remember ... something about my father. A  warm glow. A smile. I had always assumed he knew me as a baby. My mom had never said it outright, but still, I'd  felt it must be true. Now, to be told that he'd never even seen me ... I felt angry at my father. Maybe it was stupid, but I resented him for going on that ocean  voyage, for not having the guts to marry my mom. He'd left us, and now we were stuck with  Smelly Gabe. ""Are you going to send me away again?"" I asked her. ""To another boarding school?"" She pulled a marshmallow from the fire. ""I don't know, honey."" Her voice was heavy. ""I think ... I think we'll have to do something."" ""Because you don't want me around?"" I regretted the words as soon as they were out. My mom's eyes welled with tears. She took my hand, squeezed it tight. ""Oh, Percy, no. I—I  have to, honey. For your own good. I have to send you away."" Her words reminded me of what Mr. Brunner had said—that it was best for me to leave  Yancy. ""Because I'm not normal,"" I said. ""You say that as if it's a bad thing, Percy. But you don't realize how important you are. I  thought Yancy Academy would be far enough away. I thought you'd finally be safe."" ""Safe from what?"" She met my eyes, and a flood of memories came back to me—all the weird, scary things that  had ever happened to me, some of which I'd tried to forget. During third grade, a man in a black trench coat had stalked me on the playground. When the  teachers threatened to call the police, he went away growling, but no one believed me when I told  them that under his broad-brimmed hat, the man only had one eye, right in the middle of his head. Before that—a really early memory. I was in preschool, and a teacher accidentally put me  down for a nap in a cot that a snake had slithered into. My mom screamed when she came to pick  me up and found me playing with a limp, scaly rope I'd somehow managed to strangle to death  with my meaty toddler hands. In every single school, something creepy had happened, something unsafe, and I was forced  to move. I knew I should tell my mom about the old ladies at the fruit stand, and Mrs. Dodds at the art  museum, about my weird hallucination that I had sliced my math teacher into dust with a sword.  But I couldn't make myself tell her. I had a strange feeling the news would end our trip to  Montauk, and I didn't want that. ""I've tried to keep you as close to me as I could,"" my mom said. ""They told me that was a  mistake. But there's only one other option, Percy—the place your father wanted to send you. And  I just... I just can't stand to do it."" ""My father wanted me to go to a special school?"" ""Not a school,"" she said softly. ""A summer camp."" My head was spinning. Why would my dad—who hadn't even stayed around long enough to  see me born— talk to my mom about a summer camp? And if it was so important, why hadn't she  ever mentioned it before? ""I'm sorry, Percy,"" she said, seeing the look in my eyes. ""But I can't talk about it. I—I  couldn't send you to that place. It might mean saying good-bye to you for good."" ""For good? But if it's only a summer camp ..."" She turned toward the fire, and I knew from her expression that if I asked her any more  questions she would start to cry. That night I had a vivid dream. It was storming on the beach, and two beautiful animals, a white horse and a golden eagle,  were trying to kill each other at the edge of the surf. The eagle swooped down and slashed the  horse's muzzle with its huge talons. The horse reared up and kicked at the eagles wings. As they  fought, the ground rumbled, and a monstrous voice chuckled somewhere beneath the earth,  goading the animals to fight harder. I ran toward them, knowing I had to stop them from killing each other, but I was running in  slow motion. I knew I would be too late. I saw the eagle dive down, its beak aimed at the horse's  wide eyes, and I screamed, No! I woke with a start. Outside, it really was storming, the kind of storm that cracks trees and blows down houses.  There was no horse or eagle on the beach, just lightning making false daylight, and twenty-foot  waves pounding the dunes like artillery. With the next thunderclap, my mom woke. She sat up, eyes wide, and said, ""Hurricane."" I knew that was crazy. Long Island never sees hurricanes this early in the summer. But the  ocean seemed to have forgotten. Over the roar of the wind, I heard a distant bellow, an angry,  tortured sound that made my hair stand on end. Then a much closer noise, like mallets in the sand. A desperate voice—someone yelling,  pounding on our cabin door. My mother sprang out of bed in her nightgown and threw open the lock. Grover stood framed in the doorway against a backdrop of pouring rain. But he wasn't... he  wasn't exactly Grover. ""Searching all night,"" he gasped. ""What were you thinking?"" My mother looked at me in terror—not scared of Grover, but of why he'd come. ""Percy,"" she said, shouting to be heard over the rain. ""What happened at school? What didn't  you tell me?"" I was frozen, looking at Grover. I couldn't understand what I was seeing. ""O Zeu kai alloi theoi!"" he yelled. ""It's right behind me! Didn't you tell her?"" I was too shocked to register that he'd just cursed in Ancient Greek, and I'd understood him  perfectly. I was too shocked to wonder how Grover had gotten here by himself in the middle of  the night. Because Grover didn't have his pants on—and where his legs should be ... where his  legs should be ... My mom looked at me sternly and talked in a tone she'd never used before: ""Percy. Tell me  now!"" I stammered something about the old ladies at the fruit stand, and Mrs. Dodds, and my mom  stared at me, her face deathly pale in the flashes of lightning. She grabbed her purse, tossed me my rain jacket, and said, ""Get to the car. Both of you. Go!"" Grover ran for the Camaro—but he wasn't running, exactly. He was trotting, shaking his  shaggy hindquarters, and suddenly his story about a muscular disorder in his legs made sense to  me. I understood how he could run so fast and still limp when he walked. Because where his feet should be, there were no feet. There were cloven hooves. "
Percy Jackson 1 Chapter 4,"We tore through the night along dark country roads. Wind slammed against the Camaro. Rain  lashed the windshield. I didn't know how my mom could see anything, but she kept her foot on  the gas. Every time there was a flash of lightning, I looked at Grover sitting next to me in the backseat  and I wondered if I'd gone insane, or if he was wearing some kind of shag-carpet pants. But, no, the smell was one I remembered from kindergarten field trips to the petting zoo— lanolin, like  from wool. The smell of a wet barnyard animal. All I could think to say was, ""So, you and my mom... know each other?"" Graver's eyes flitted to the rearview mirror, though there were no cars behind us. ""Not  exactly,"" he said. ""I mean, we've never met in person. But she knew I was watching you."" ""Watching me?"" ""Keeping tabs on you. Making sure you were okay. But I wasn't faking being your friend,"" he  added hastily. ""I am your friend."" ""Urn ... what are you, exactly?"" ""That doesn't matter right now."" ""It doesn't matter? From the waist down, my best friend is a donkey—"" Grover let out a sharp, throaty ""Blaa-ha-ha!"" I'd heard him make that sound before, but I'd always assumed it was a nervous laugh. Now I  realized it was more of an irritated bleat. ""Goat!"" he cried. ""What?"" ""I'm a goat from the waist down."" ""You just said it didn't matter."" ""Blaa-ha-ha! There are satyrs who would trample you underhoof for such an insult!"" ""Whoa. Wait. Satyrs. You mean like ... Mr. Brunner's myths?"" ""Were those old ladies at the fruit stand a myth, Percy? Was Mrs. Dodds a myth?"" ""So you admit there was a Mrs. Dodds!"" ""Of course."" ""Then why—""  ""The less you knew, the fewer monsters you'd attract,"" Grover said, like that should be  perfectly obvious. ""We put Mist over the humans' eyes. We hoped you'd think the Kindly One  was a hallucination. But it was no good. You started to realize who you are."" ""Who I—wait a minute, what do you mean?"" The weird bellowing noise rose up again somewhere behind us, closer than before. Whatever  was chasing us was still on our trail. ""Percy,"" my mom said, ""there's too much to explain and not enough time. We have to get you  to safety."" ""Safety from what? Who's after me?"" ""Oh, nobody much,"" Grover said, obviously still miffed about the donkey comment. ""Just the  Lord of the Dead and a few of his blood-thirstiest minions."" ""Grover!"" ""Sorry, Mrs. Jackson. Could you drive faster, please?"" I tried to wrap my mind around what was happening, but I couldn't do it. I knew this wasn't a  dream. I had no imagination. I could never dream up something this weird. My mom made a hard left. We swerved onto a narrower road, racing past darkened  farmhouses and wooded hills and PICK YOUR OWN STRAWBERRIES signs on white picket  fences. ""Where are we going?"" I asked. ""The summer camp I told you about."" My mother's voice was tight; she was trying for my  sake not to be scared. ""The place your father wanted to send you."" ""The place you didn't want me to go."" ""Please, dear,"" my mother begged. ""This is hard enough. Try to understand. You're in  danger."" ""Because some old ladies cut yarn."" ""Those weren't old ladies,"" Grover said. ""Those were the Fates. Do you know what it  means—the fact they appeared in front of you? They only do that when you're about to ... when  someone's about to die."" ""Whoa. You said 'you.'"" ""No I didn't. I said 'someone.'"" ""You meant 'you.' As in me."" ""I meant you, like 'someone.' Not you, you."" ""Boys!"" my mom said. She pulled the wheel hard to the right, and I got a glimpse of a figure she'd swerved to  avoid—a dark fluttering shape now lost behind us in the storm. ""What was that?"" I asked. ""We're almost there,"" my mother said, ignoring my question. ""Another mile. Please. Please.  Please."" I didn't know where there was, but I found myself leaning forward in the car, anticipating,  wanting us to arrive. Outside, nothing but rain and darkness—the kind of empty countryside you get way out on  the tip of Long Island. I thought about Mrs. Dodds and the moment when she'd changed into the  thing with pointed teeth and leathery wings. My limbs went numb from delayed shock. She really  hadn't been human. She'd meant to kill me. Then I thought about Mr. Brunner ... and the sword he had thrown me. Before I could ask  Grover about that, the hair rose on the back of my neck. There was a blinding flash, a jaw-rattling  boom!, and our car exploded. I remember feeling weightless, like I was being crushed, fried, and hosed down all at the  same time. I peeled my forehead off the back of the driver's seat and said, ""Ow."" ""Percy!"" my mom shouted. ""I'm okay... ."" I tried to shake off the daze. I wasn't dead. The car hadn't really exploded. We'd swerved into  a ditch. Our driver's-side doors were wedged in the mud. The roof had cracked open like an  eggshell and rain was pouring in. Lightning. That was the only explanation. We'd been blasted right off the road. Next to me in  the backseat was a big motionless lump. ""Grover!"" He was slumped over, blood trickling from the side of his mouth. I shook his furry hip,  thinking, No! Even if you are half barnyard animal, you're my best friend and I don't want you to  die! Then he groaned ""Food,"" and I knew there was hope. ""Percy,"" my mother said, ""we have to ..."" Her voice faltered. I looked back. In a flash of lightning, through the mud-spattered rear windshield, I saw a  figure lumbering toward us on the shoulder of the road. The sight of it made my skin crawl. It  was a dark silhouette of a huge guy, like a football player. He seemed to be holding a blanket  over his head. His top half was bulky and fuzzy. His upraised hands made it look like he had  horns. I swallowed hard. ""Who is—"" ""Percy,"" my mother said, deadly serious. ""Get out of the car."" My mother threw herself against the driver's-side door. It was jammed shut in the mud. I tried  mine. Stuck too. I looked up desperately at the hole in the roof. It might've been an exit, but the  edges were sizzling and smoking. ""Climb out the passenger's side!"" my mother told me. ""Percy—you have to run. Do you see  that big tree?"" ""What?"" Another flash of lightning, and through the smoking hole in the roof I saw the tree she meant:  a huge, White House Christmas tree-sized pine at the crest of the nearest hill. ""That's the property line,"" my mom said. ""Get over that hill and you'll see a big farmhouse  down in the valley. Run and don't look back. Yell for help. Don't stop until you reach the door."" ""Mom, you're coming too."" Her face was pale, her eyes as sad as when she looked at the ocean. ""No!"" I shouted. ""You are coming with me. Help me carry Grover."" ""Food!"" Grover moaned, a little louder. The man with the blanket on his head kept coming toward us, making his grunting, snorting  noises. As he got closer, I realized he couldn't be holding a blanket over his head, because his  hands—huge meaty hands—were swinging at his sides. There was no blanket. Meaning the  bulky, fuzzy mass that was too big to be his head ... was his head. And the points that looked like  horns ... ""He doesn't want us,"" my mother told me. ""He wants you. Besides, I can't cross the property  line."" ""But..."" ""We don't have time, Percy. Go. Please."" I got mad, then—mad at my mother, at Grover the goat, at the thing with horns that was  lumbering toward us slowly and deliberately like, like a bull. I climbed across Grover and pushed the door open into the rain. ""We're going together. Come  on, Mom."" ""I told you—"" ""Mom! I am not leaving you. Help me with Grover."" I didn't wait for her answer. I scrambled outside, dragging Grover from the car. He was  surprisingly light, but I couldn't have carried him very far if my mom hadn't come to my aid. Together, we draped Grover's arms over our shoulders and started stumbling uphill through  wet waist-high grass. Glancing back, I got my first clear look at the monster. He was seven feet tall, easy, his arms  and legs like something from the cover of Muscle Man magazine—bulging biceps and triceps and  a bunch of other 'ceps, all stuffed like baseballs under vein-webbed skin. He wore no clothes  except underwear—I mean, bright white Fruit of the Looms—which would've looked funny, except that the top half of his body was so scary. Coarse brown hair started at about his belly  button and got thicker as it reached his shoulders. His neck was a mass of muscle and fur leading up to his enormous head, which had a snout as  long as my arm, snotty nostrils with a gleaming brass ring, cruel black eyes, and horns— enormous black-and-white horns with points you just couldn't get from an electric sharpener. I recognized the monster, all right. He had been in one of the first stories Mr. Brunner told us.  But he couldn't be real. I blinked the rain out of my eyes. ""That's—"" ""Pasiphae's son,"" my mother said. ""I wish I'd known how badly they want to kill you."" ""But he's the Min—"" ""Don't say his name,"" she warned. ""Names have power."" The pine tree was still way too far—a hundred yards uphill at least. I glanced behind me again. The bull-man hunched over our car, looking in the windows—or not looking, exactly. More  like snuffling, nuzzling. I wasn't sure why he bothered, since we were only about fifty feet away. ""Food?"" Grover moaned. ""Shhh,"" I told him. ""Mom, what's he doing? Doesn't he see us?"" ""His sight and hearing are terrible,"" she said. ""He goes by smell. But he'll figure out where  we are soon enough."" As if on cue, the bull-man bellowed in rage. He picked up Gabe's Camaro by the torn roof,  the chassis creaking and groaning. He raised the car over his head and threw it down the road. It  slammed into the wet asphalt and skidded in a shower of sparks for about half a mile before  coming to a stop. The gas tank exploded. Not a scratch, I remembered Gabe saying. Oops.  ""Percy,"" my mom said. ""When he sees us, he'll charge. Wait until the last second, then jump  out of the way— directly sideways. He can't change directions very well once he's charging. Do  you understand?"" ""How do you know all this?"" ""I've been worried about an attack for a long time. I should have expected this. I was selfish,  keeping you near me.""  ""Keeping me near you? But—"" Another bellow of rage, and the bull-man started tromping uphill. He'd smelled us. The pine tree was only a few more yards, but the hill was getting steeper and slicker, and  Grover wasn't getting any lighter. The bull-man closed in. Another few seconds and he'd be on top of us. My mother must've been exhausted, but she shouldered Grover. ""Go, Percy! Separate!  Remember what I said."" I didn't want to split up, but I had the feeling she was right—it was our only chance. I sprinted  to the left, turned, and saw the creature bearing down on me. His black eyes glowed with hate. He  reeked like rotten meat. He lowered his head and charged, those razor-sharp horns aimed straight at my chest. The fear in my stomach made me want to bolt, but that wouldn't work. I could never outrun  this thing. So I held my ground, and at the last moment, I jumped to the side. The bull-man stormed past like a freight train, then bellowed with frustration and turned, but  not toward me this time, toward my mother, who was setting Grover down in the grass. We'd reached the crest of the hill. Down the other side I could see a valley, just as my mother  had said, and the lights of a farmhouse glowing yellow through the rain. But that was half a mile  away. We'd never make it. The bull-man grunted, pawing the ground. He kept eyeing my mother, who was now  retreating slowly downhill, back toward the road, trying to lead the monster away from Grover. ""Run, Percy!"" she told me. ""I can't go any farther. Run!"" But I just stood there, frozen in fear, as the monster charged her. She tried to sidestep, as  she'd told me to do, but the monster had learned his lesson. His hand shot out and grabbed her by  the neck as she tried to get away. He lifted her as she struggled, kicking and pummeling the air. ""Mom!"" She caught my eyes, managed to choke out one last word: ""Go!"" Then, with an angry roar, the monster closed his fists around my mother's neck, and she  dissolved before my eyes, melting into light, a shimmering golden form, as if she were a  holographic projection. A blinding flash, and she was simply ... gone. ""No!"" Anger replaced my fear. Newfound strength burned in my limbs—the same rush of energy I'd  gotten when Mrs. Dodds grew talons. The bull-man bore down on Grover, who lay helpless in the grass. The monster hunched  over, snuffling my best friend, as if he were about to lift Grover up and make him dissolve too. I couldn't allow that. I stripped off my red rain jacket. ""Hey!"" I screamed, waving the jacket, running to one side of the monster. ""Hey, stupid!  Ground beef!"" ""Raaaarrrrr!"" The monster turned toward me, shaking his meaty fists. I had an idea—a stupid idea, but better than no idea at all. I put my back to the big pine tree  and waved my red jacket in front of the bull-man, thinking I'd jump out of the way at the last  moment. But it didn't happen like that. The bull-man charged too fast, his arms out to grab me whichever way I tried to dodge. Time slowed down. My legs tensed. I couldn't jump sideways, so I leaped straight up, kicking off from the  creature's head, using it as a springboard, turning in midair, and landing on his neck. How did I do that? I didn't have time to figure it out. A millisecond later, the monster's head  slammed into the tree and the impact nearly knocked my teeth out. The bull-man staggered around, trying to shake me. I locked my arms around his horns to  keep from being thrown. Thunder and lightning were still going strong. The rain was in my eyes.  The smell of rotten meat burned my nostrils. The monster shook himself around and bucked like a rodeo bull. He should have just backed  up into the tree and smashed me flat, but I was starting to realize that this thing had only one gear:  forward. Meanwhile, Grover started groaning in the grass. I wanted to yell at him to shut up, but the  way I was getting tossed around, if I opened my mouth I'd bite my own tongue off. ""Food!"" Grover moaned. The bull-man wheeled toward him, pawed the ground again, and got ready to charge. I  thought about how he had squeezed the life out of my mother, made her disappear in a flash of  light, and rage filled me like high-octane fuel. I got both hands around one horn and I pulled  backward with all my might. The monster tensed, gave a surprised grunt, then—snap! The bull-man screamed and flung me through the air. I landed flat on my back in the grass.  My head smacked against a rock. When I sat up, my vision was blurry, but I had a horn in my  hands, a ragged bone weapon the size of a knife. The monster charged. Without thinking, I rolled to one side and came up kneeling. As the monster barreled past, I  drove the broken horn straight into his side, right up under his furry rib cage. The bull-man roared in agony. He flailed, clawing at his chest, then began to disintegrate— not like my mother, in a flash of golden light, but like crumbling sand, blown away in chunks by  the wind, the same way Mrs. Dodds had burst apart. The monster was gone. The rain had stopped. The storm still rumbled, but only in the distance. I smelled like  livestock and my knees were shaking. My head felt like it was splitting open. I was weak and  scared and trembling with grief I'd just seen my mother vanish. I wanted to lie down and cry, but  there was Grover, needing my help, so I managed to haul him up and stagger down into the  valley, toward the lights of the farmhouse. I was crying, calling for my mother, but I held on to  Grover—I wasn't going to let him go. The last thing I remember is collapsing on a wooden porch, looking up at a ceiling fan  circling above me, moths flying around a yellow light, and the stern faces of a familiar-looking  bearded man and a pretty girl, her blond hair curled like a princess's. They both looked down at  me, and the girl said, ""He's the one. He must be."" ""Silence, Annabeth,"" the man said. ""He's still conscious. Bring him inside."""
Percy Jackson 1 Chapter 5,"I had weird dreams full of barnyard animals. Most of them wanted to kill me. The rest wanted  food. I must've woken up several times, but what I heard and saw made no sense, so I just passed  out again. I remember lying in a soft bed, being spoon-fed something that tasted like buttered  popcorn, only it was pudding. The girl with curly blond hair hovered over me, smirking as she  scraped drips off my chin with the spoon. When she saw my eyes open, she asked, ""What will happen at the summer solstice?"" I managed to croak, ""What?"" She looked around, as if afraid someone would overhear. ""What's going on? What was  stolen? We've only got a few weeks!"" ""I'm sorry,"" I mumbled, ""I don't..."" Somebody knocked on the door, and the girl quickly filled my mouth with pudding. The next time I woke up, the girl was gone. A husky blond dude, like a surfer, stood in the corner of the bedroom keeping watch over me.  He had blue eyes— at least a dozen of them—on his cheeks, his forehead, the backs of his hands.   * * *  When I finally came around for good, there was nothing weird about my surroundings, except  that they were nicer than I was used to. I was sitting in a deck chair on a huge porch, gazing  across a meadow at green hills in the distance. The breeze smelled like strawberries. There was a  blanket over my legs, a pillow behind my neck. All that was great, but my mouth felt like a  scorpion had been using it for a nest. My tongue was dry and nasty and every one of my teeth  hurt. On the table next to me was a tall drink. It looked like iced apple juice, with a green straw  and a paper parasol stuck through a maraschino cherry. My hand was so weak I almost dropped the glass once I got my fingers around it. ""Careful,"" a familiar voice said. Grover was leaning against the porch railing, looking like he hadn't slept in a week. Under  one arm, he cradled a shoe box. He was wearing blue jeans, Converse hi-tops and a bright orange  T-shirt that said CAMP HALF-BLOOD. Just plain old Grover, Not the goat boy. So maybe I'd had a nightmare. Maybe my mom was okay. We were still on vacation, and  we'd stopped here at this big house for some reason. And ... ""You saved my life,"" Grover said. ""I... well, the least I could do ... I went back to the hill. I  thought you might want this."" Reverently, he placed the shoe box in my lap. Inside was a black-and-white bull's horn, the base jagged from being broken off, the tip  splattered with dried blood. It hadn't been a nightmare. ""The Minotaur,"" I said. ""Urn, Percy, it isn't a good idea—"" ""That's what they call him in the Greek myths, isn't it?"" I demanded. ""The Minotaur. Half  man, half bull."" Grover shifted uncomfortably. ""You've been out for two days. How much do you  remember?"" ""My mom. Is she really ..."" He looked down. I stared across the meadow. There were groves of trees, a winding stream, acres of  strawberries spread out under the blue sky. The valley was surrounded by rolling hills, and the  tallest one, directly in front of us, was the one with the huge pine tree on top. Even that looked  beautiful in the sunlight. My mother was gone. The whole world should be black and cold. Nothing should look  beautiful. ""I'm sorry,"" Grover sniffled. ""I'm a failure. I'm—I'm the worst satyr in the world."" He moaned, stomping his foot so hard it came off. I mean, the Converse hi-top came off. The  inside was filled with Styrofoam, except for a hoof-shaped hole. ""Oh, Styx!"" he mumbled. Thunder rolled across the clear sky. As he struggled to get his hoof back in the fake foot, I thought, Well, that settles it. Grover was a satyr. I was ready to bet that if I shaved his curly brown hair, I'd find tiny horns  on his head. But I was too miserable to care that satyrs existed, or even minotaurs. All that meant  was my mom really had been squeezed into nothingness, dissolved into yellow light. I was alone. An orphan. I would have to live with ... Smelly Gabe? No. That would never  happen. I would live on the streets first. I would pretend I was seventeen and join the army. I'd do  something. Grover was still sniffling. The poor kid—poor goat, satyr, whatever—looked as if he  expected to be hit. I said, ""It wasn't your fault."" ""Yes, it was. I was supposed to protect you."" ""Did my mother ask you to protect me?""  ""No. But that's my job. I'm a keeper. At least... I was."" ""But why ..."" I suddenly felt dizzy, my vision swimming. ""Don't strain yourself,"" Grover said. ""Here."" He helped me hold my glass and put the straw to  my lips.  I recoiled at the taste, because I was expecting apple juice. It wasn't that at all. It was  chocolate-chip cookies. Liquid cookies. And not just any cookies—my mom's homemade blue  chocolate-chip cookies, buttery and hot, with the chips still melting. Drinking it, my whole body  felt warm and good, full of energy. My grief didn't go away, but I felt as if my mom had just  brushed her hand against my cheek, given me a cookie the way she used to when I was small, and  told me everything was going to be okay. Before I knew it, I'd drained the glass. I stared into it, sure I'd just had a warm drink, but the  ice cubes hadn't even melted. ""Was it good?"" Grover asked. I nodded. ""What did it taste like?"" He sounded so wistful, I felt guilty. ""Sorry,"" I said. ""I should've let you taste."" His eyes got wide. ""No! That's not what I meant. I just... wondered."" ""Chocolate-chip cookies,"" I said. ""My mom's. Homemade."" He sighed. ""And how do you feel?"" ""Like I could throw Nancy Bobofit a hundred yards."" ""That's good,"" he said. ""That's good. I don't think you could risk drinking any more of that  stuff"" ""What do you mean?"" He took the empty glass from me gingerly, as if it were dynamite, and set it back on the table.  ""Come on. Chiron and Mr. D are waiting."" The porch wrapped all the way around the farmhouse. My legs felt wobbly, trying to walk that far. Grover offered to carry the Minotaur horn, but I  held on to it. I'd paid for that souvenir the hard way. I wasn't going to let it go. As we came around the opposite end of the house, I caught my breath. We must've been on the north shore of Long Island, because on this side of the house, the  valley marched all the way up to the water, which glittered about a mile in the distance. Between  here and there, I simply couldn't process everything I was seeing. The landscape was dotted with  buildings that looked like ancient Greek architecture—an open-air pavilion, an amphitheater, a  circular arena—except that they all looked brand new, their white marble columns sparkling in  the sun. In a nearby sandpit, a dozen high school-age kids and satyrs played volleyball. Canoes  glided across a small lake. Kids in bright orange T-shirts like Grover's were chasing each other around a cluster of cabins nestled in the woods. Some shot targets at an archery range. Others  rode horses down a wooded trail, and, unless I was hallucinating, some of their horses had wings. Down at the end of the porch, two men sat across from each other at a card table. The blond haired girl who'd spoon-fed me popcorn-flavored pudding was leaning on the porch rail next to  them. The man facing me was small, but porky. He had a red nose, big watery eyes, and curly hair  so black it was almost purple. He looked like those paintings of baby angels— what do you call  them, hubbubs? No, cherubs. That's it. He looked like a cherub who'd turned middle-aged in a  trailer park. He wore a tiger-pattern Hawaiian shirt, and he would've fit right in at one of Gabe's  poker parties, except I got the feeling this guy could've out-gambled even my stepfather. ""That's Mr. D,"" Grover murmured to me. ""He's the camp director. Be polite. The girl, that's  Annabeth Chase. She's just a camper, but she's been here longer than just about anybody. And  you already know Chiron... ."" He pointed at the guy whose back was to me. First, I realized he was sitting in the wheelchair. Then I recognized the tweed jacket, the  thinning brown hair, the scraggly beard. ""Mr. Brunner!"" I cried. The Latin teacher turned and smiled at me. His eyes had that mischievous glint they  sometimes got in class when he pulled a pop quiz and made all the multiple choice answers B. ""Ah, good, Percy,"" he said. ""Now we have four for pinochle."" He offered me a chair to the right of Mr. D, who looked at me with bloodshot eyes and  heaved a great sigh. ""Oh, I suppose I must say it. Welcome to Camp Half-Blood. There. Now,  don't expect me to be glad to see you."" ""Uh, thanks."" I scooted a little farther away from him because, if there was one thing I had  learned from living with Gabe, it was how to tell when an adult has been hitting the happy juice.  If Mr. D was a stranger to alcohol, I was a satyr. ""Annabeth?"" Mr. Brunner called to the blond girl. She came forward and Mr. Brunner introduced us. ""This young lady nursed you back to  health, Percy. Annabeth, my dear, why don't you go check on Percy's bunk? We'll be putting him  in cabin eleven for now."" Annabeth said, ""Sure, Chiron."" She was probably my age, maybe a couple of inches taller, and a whole lot more athletic  looking. With her deep tan and her curly blond hair, she was almost exactly what I thought a  stereotypical California girl would look like, except her eyes ruined the image. They were  startling gray, like storm clouds; pretty, but intimidating, too, as if she were analyzing the best  way to take me down in a fight. She glanced at the minotaur horn in my hands, then back at me. I imagined she was going to  say, You killed a minotaur! or Wow, you're so awesome! or something like that. Instead she said, ""You drool when you sleep."" Then she sprinted off down the lawn, her blond hair flying behind her. ""So,"" I said, anxious to change the subject. ""You, uh, work here, Mr. Brunner?""  ""Not Mr. Brunner,"" the ex—Mr. Brunner said. ""I'm afraid that was a pseudonym. You may  call me Chiron."" ""Okay."" Totally confused, I looked at the director. ""And Mr. D ... does that stand for  something?"" Mr. D stopped shuffling the cards. He looked at me like I'd just belched loudly. ""Young man,  names are powerful things. You don't just go around using them for no reason."" ""Oh. Right. Sorry."" ""I must say, Percy,"" Chiron-Brunner broke in, ""I'm glad to see you alive. It's been a long time  since I've made a house call to a potential camper. I'd hate to think I've wasted my time."" ""House call?"" ""My year at Yancy Academy, to instruct you. We have satyrs at most schools, of course,  keeping a lookout. But Grover alerted me as soon as he met you. He sensed you were something  special, so I decided to come upstate. I convinced the other Latin teacher to ... ah, take a leave of  absence."" I tried to remember the beginning of the school year. It seemed like so long ago, but I did  have a fuzzy memory of there being another Latin teacher my first week at Yancy. Then, without  explanation, he had disappeared and Mr. Brunner had taken the class. ""You came to Yancy just to teach me?"" I asked. Chiron nodded. ""Honestly, I wasn't sure about you at first. We contacted your mother, let her  know we were keeping an eye on you in case you were ready for Camp Half-Blood. But you still  had so much to learn. Nevertheless, you made it here alive, and that's always the first test."" ""Grover,"" Mr. D said impatiently, ""are you playing or not?"" ""Yes, sir!"" Grover trembled as he took the fourth chair, though I didn't know why he should  be so afraid of a pudgy little man in a tiger-print Hawaiian shirt. ""You do know how to play pinochle?"" Mr. D eyed me suspiciously. ""I'm afraid not,"" I said. ""I'm afraid not, sir,"" he said. ""Sir,"" I repeated. I was liking the camp director less and less. ""Well,"" he told me, ""it is, along with gladiator fighting and Pac-Man, one of the greatest  games ever invented by humans. I would expect all civilized young men to know the rules."" ""I'm sure the boy can learn,"" Chiron said. ""Please,"" I said, ""what is this place? What am I doing here? Mr. Brun—Chiron—why would  you go to Yancy Academy just to teach me?"" Mr. D snorted. ""I asked the same question."" The camp director dealt the cards. Grover flinched every time one landed in his pile. Chiron smiled at me sympathetically, the way he used to in Latin class, as if to let me know  that no matter what my average was, I was his star student. He expected me to have the right  answer. ""Percy,"" he said. ""Did your mother tell you nothing?' ""She said ..."" I remembered her sad eyes, looking out over the sea. ""She told me she was  afraid to send me here, even though my father had wanted her to. She said that once I was here, I  probably couldn't leave. She wanted to keep me close to her."" ""Typical,"" Mr. D said. ""That's how they usually get killed. Young man, are you bidding or  not?"" ""What?"" I asked. He explained, impatiently, how you bid in pinochle, and so I did.  ""I'm afraid there's too much to tell,"" Chiron said. ""I'm afraid our usual orientation film won't  be sufficient."" ""Orientation film?"" I asked. ""No,"" Chiron decided. ""Well, Percy. You know your friend Grover is a satyr. You know""— he pointed to the horn in the shoe box—""that you have killed the Minotaur. No small feat, either,  lad. What you may not know is that great powers are at work in your life. Gods—the forces you  call the Greek gods—are very much alive."" I stared at the others around the table. I waited for somebody to yell, Not! But all I got was Mr. D yelling, ""Oh, a royal marriage.  Trick! Trick!"" He cackled as he tallied up his points. ""Mr. D,"" Grover asked timidly, ""if you're not going to eat it, could I have your Diet Coke  can?"" ""Eh? Oh, all right.""  Grover bit a huge shard out of the empty aluminum can and chewed it mournfully. ""Wait,"" I told Chiron. ""You're telling me there's such a thing as God."" ""Well, now,"" Chiron said. ""God—capital G, God. That's a different matter altogether. We  shan't deal with the metaphysical."" ""Metaphysical? But you were just talking about—"" ""Ah, gods, plural, as in, great beings that control the forces of nature and human endeavors:  the immortal gods of Olympus. That's a smaller matter."" ""Smaller?"" ""Yes, quite. The gods we discussed in Latin class."" ""Zeus,"" I said. ""Hera. Apollo. You mean them."" And there it was again—distant thunder on a cloudless day. ""Young man,"" said Mr. D, ""I would really be less casual about throwing those names around,  if I were you."" ""But they're stories,"" I said. ""They're—myths, to explain lightning and the seasons and stuff.  They're what people believed before there was science."" ""Science!"" Mr. D scoffed. ""And tell me, Perseus Jackson""—I flinched when he said my real  name, which I never told anybody—""what will people think of your 'science' two thousand years  from now?"" Mr. D continued. ""Hmm? They will call it primitive mumbo jumbo. That's what. Oh,  I love mortals—they have absolutely no sense of perspective. They think they've come so-o-o far.  And have they, Chiron? Look at this boy and tell me."" I wasn't liking Mr. D much, but there was something about the way he called me mortal, as  if... he wasn't. It was enough to put a lump in my throat, to suggest why Grover was dutifully  minding his cards, chewing his soda can, and keeping his mouth shut. ""Percy,"" Chiron said, ""you may choose to believe or not, but the fact is that immortal means  immortal. Can you imagine that for a moment, never dying? Never fading? Existing, just as you  are, for all time?"" I was about to answer, off the top of my head, that it sounded like a pretty good deal, but the  tone of Chiron's voice made me hesitate. ""You mean, whether people believed in you or not,"" I said. ""Exactly,"" Chiron agreed. ""If you were a god, how would you like being called a myth, an  old story to explain lightning? What if I told you, Perseus Jackson, that someday people would  call you a myth, just created to explain how little boys can get over losing their mothers?"" My heart pounded. He was trying to make me angry for some reason, but I wasn't going to let  him. I said, ""I wouldn't like it. But I don't believe in gods."" ""Oh, you'd better,"" Mr. D murmured. ""Before one of them incinerates you."" Grover said, ""P-please, sir. He's just lost his mother. He's in shock."" ""A lucky thing, too,"" Mr. D grumbled, playing a card. ""Bad enough I'm confined to this  miserable job, working with boys who don't even believe.'"" He waved his hand and a goblet appeared on the table, as if the sunlight had bent,  momentarily, and woven the air into glass. The goblet filled itself with red wine. My jaw dropped, but Chiron hardly looked up. ""Mr. D,"" he warned, ""your restrictions."" Mr. D looked at the wine and feigned surprise. ""Dear me."" He looked at the sky and yelled, ""Old habits! Sorry!"" More thunder. Mr. D waved his hand again, and the wineglass changed into a fresh can of Diet Coke. He  sighed unhappily, popped the top of the soda, and went back to his card game. Chiron winked at me. ""Mr. D offended his father a while back, took a fancy to a wood nymph  who had been declared off-limits."" ""A wood nymph,"" I repeated, still staring at the Diet Coke can like it was from outer space. ""Yes,"" Mr. D confessed. ""Father loves to punish me. The first time, Prohibition. Ghastly!  Absolutely horrid ten years! The second time—well, she really was pretty, and I couldn't stay  away—the second time, he sent me here. Half-Blood Hill. Summer camp for brats like you. 'Be a  better influence,' he told me. 'Work with youths rather than tearing them down.' Ha.' Absolutely  unfair."" Mr. D sounded about six years old, like a pouting little kid.  ""And ..."" I stammered, ""your father is ..."" ""Di immortales, Chiron,"" Mr. D said. ""I thought you taught this boy the basics. My father is  Zeus, of course."" I ran through D names from Greek mythology. Wine. The skin of a tiger. The satyrs that all  seemed to work here. The way Grover cringed, as if Mr. D were his master. ""You're Dionysus,"" I said. ""The god of wine."" Mr. D rolled his eyes. ""What do they say, these days, Grover? Do the children say, 'Well,  duh!'?"" ""Y-yes, Mr. D.""  ""Then, well, duh! Percy Jackson. Did you think I was Aphrodite, perhaps?"" ""You're a god."" ""Yes, child."" ""A god. You."" He turned to look at me straight on, and I saw a kind of purplish fire in his eyes, a hint that  this whiny, plump little man was only showing me the tiniest bit of his true nature. I saw visions  of grape vines choking unbelievers to death, drunken warriors insane with battle lust, sailors  screaming as their hands turned to flippers, their faces elongating into dolphin snouts. I knew that  if I pushed him, Mr. D would show me worse things. He would plant a disease in my brain that  would leave me wearing a strait-jacket in a rubber room for the rest of my life. ""Would you like to test me, child?"" he said quietly. ""No. No, sir."" The fire died a little. He turned back to his card game. ""I believe I win."" ""Not quite, Mr. D,"" Chiron said. He set down a straight, tallied the points, and said, ""The  game goes to me."" I thought Mr. D was going to vaporize Chiron right out of his wheelchair, but he just sighed  through his nose, as if he were used to being beaten by the Latin teacher. He got up, and Grover  rose, too. ""I'm tired,"" Mr. D said. ""I believe I'll take a nap before the sing-along tonight. But first,  Grover, we need to talk, again, about your less-than-perfect performance on this assignment."" Grover's face beaded with sweat. ""Y-yes, sir."" Mr. D turned to me. ""Cabin eleven, Percy Jackson. And mind your manners."" He swept into the farmhouse, Grover following miserably. ""Will Grover be okay?"" I asked Chiron. Chiron nodded, though he looked a bit troubled. ""Old Dionysus isn't really mad. He just hates  his job. He's been ... ah, grounded, I guess you would say, and he can't stand waiting another  century before he's allowed to go back to Olympus."" ""Mount Olympus,"" I said. ""You're telling me there really is a palace there?"" ""Well now, there's Mount Olympus in Greece. And then there's the home of the gods, the  convergence point of their powers, which did indeed used to be on Mount Olympus. It's still  called Mount Olympus, out of respect to the old ways, but the palace moves, Percy, just as the  gods do."" ""You mean the Greek gods are here? Like ... in America?"" ""Well, certainly. The gods move with the heart of the West."" ""The what?"" ""Come now, Percy. What you call 'Western civilization.' Do you think it's just an abstract  concept? No, it's a living force. A collective consciousness that has burned bright for thousands of  years. The gods are part of it. You might even say they are the source of it, or at least, they are  tied so tightly to it that they couldn't possibly fade, not unless all of Western civilization were  obliterated. The fire started in Greece. Then, as you well know—or as I hope you know, since  you passed my course—the heart of the fire moved to Rome, and so did the gods. Oh, different  names, perhaps—Jupiter for Zeus, Venus for Aphrodite, and so on—but the same forces, the  same gods."" ""And then they died."" ""Died? No. Did the West die? The gods simply moved, to Germany, to France, to Spain, for a  while. Wherever the flame was brightest, the gods were there. They spent several centuries in  England. All you need to do is look at the architecture. People do not forget the gods. Every place  they've ruled, for the last three thousand years, you can see them in paintings, in statues, on the  most important buildings. And yes, Percy, of course they are now in your United States. Look at  your symbol, the eagle of Zeus. Look at the statue of Prometheus in Rockefeller Center, the  Greek facades of your government buildings in Washington. I defy you to find any American city  where the Olympians are not prominently displayed in multiple places. Like it or not—and  believe me, plenty of people weren't very fond of Rome, either—America is now the heart of the  flame. It is the great power of the West. And so Olympus is here. And we are here."" It was all too much, especially the fact that I seemed to be included in Chiron's we, as if I  were part of some club. ""Who are you, Chiron? Who ... who am I?"" Chiron smiled. He shifted his weight as if he were going to get up out of his wheelchair, but I  knew that was impossible. He was paralyzed from the waist down. ""Who are you?"" he mused. ""Well, that's the question we all want answered, isn't it? But for  now, we should get you a bunk in cabin eleven. There will be new friends to meet. And plenty of  time for lessons tomorrow. Besides, there will be s'mores at the campfire tonight, and I simply  adore chocolate."" And then he did rise from his wheelchair. But there was something odd about the way he did  it. His blanket fell away from his legs, but the legs didn't move. His waist kept getting longer,  rising above his belt. At first, I thought he was wearing very long, white velvet underwear, but as  he kept rising out of the chair, taller than any man, I realized that the velvet underwear wasn't  underwear; it was the front of an animal, muscle and sinew under coarse white fur. And the  wheelchair wasn't a chair. It was some kind of container, an enormous box on wheels, and it  must've been magic, because there's no way it could've held all of him. A leg came out, long and  knobby-kneed, with a huge polished hoof. Then another front leg, then hindquarters, and then the  box was empty, nothing but a metal shell with a couple of fake human legs attached.  I stared at the horse who had just sprung from the wheelchair: a huge white stallion. But  where its neck should be was the upper body of my Latin teacher, smoothly grafted to the horse's  trunk. ""What a relief,"" the centaur said. ""I'd been cooped up in there so long, my fetlocks had fallen  asleep. Now, come, Percy Jackson. Let's meet the other campers."" "
Percy Jackson 1 Chapter 6,"Once I got over the fact that my Latin teacher was a horse, we had a nice tour, though I was  careful not to walk behind him. I'd done pooper-scooper patrol in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day  Parade a few times, and, I'm sorry, I did not trust Chiron's back end the way I trusted his front. We passed the volleyball pit. Several of the campers nudged each other. One pointed to the  minotaur horn I was carrying. Another said, ""That's him."" Most of the campers were older than me. Their satyr friends were bigger than Grover, all of  them trotting around in orange CAMP HALF-BLOOD T-shirts, with nothing else to cover their  bare shaggy hindquarters. I wasn't normally shy, but the way they stared at me made me  uncomfortable. I felt like they were expecting me to do a flip or something. I looked back at the farmhouse. It was a lot bigger than I'd realized—four stories tall, sky blue  with white trim, like an upscale seaside resort. I was checking out the brass eagle weather vane on  top when something caught my eye, a shadow in the uppermost window of the attic gable.  Something had moved the curtain, just for a second, and I got the distinct impression I was being  watched. ""What's up there?"" I asked Chiron. He looked where I was pointing, and his smile faded. ""Just the attic."" ""Somebody lives there?"" ""No,"" he said with finality. ""Not a single living thing."" I got the feeling he was being truthful. But I was also sure something had moved that curtain. ""Come along, Percy,"" Chiron said, his lighthearted tone now a little forced. ""Lots to see."" We walked through the strawberry fields, where campers were picking bushels of berries while a  satyr played a tune on a reed pipe.  Chiron told me the camp grew a nice crop for export to New York restaurants and Mount  Olympus. ""It pays our expenses,"" he explained. ""And the strawberries take almost no effort."" He said Mr. D had this effect on fruit-bearing plants: they just went crazy when he was  around. It worked best with wine grapes, but Mr. D was restricted from growing those, so they  grew strawberries instead. I watched the satyr playing his pipe. His music was causing lines of bugs to leave the  strawberry patch in every direction, like refugees fleeing a fire. I wondered if Grover could work  that kind of magic with music. I wondered if he was still inside the farmhouse, getting chewed  out by Mr. D. ""Grover won't get in too much trouble, will he?"" I asked Chiron. ""I mean ... he was a good  protector. Really."" Chiron sighed. He shed his tweed jacket and draped it over his horses back like a saddle.  ""Grover has big dreams, Percy. Perhaps bigger than are reasonable. To reach his goal, he must  first demonstrate great courage by succeeding as a keeper, finding a new camper and bringing  him safely to Half-Blood Hill."" ""But he did that!"" ""I might agree with you,"" Chiron said. ""But it is not my place to judge. Dionysus and the  Council of Cloven Elders must decide. I'm afraid they might not see this assignment as a success.  After all, Grover lost you in New York. Then there's the unfortunate ... ah ... fate of your mother.  And the fact that Grover was unconscious when you dragged him over the property line. The  council might question whether this shows any courage on Grover's part."" I wanted to protest. None of what happened was Grover's fault. I also felt really, really guilty.  If I hadn't given Grover the slip at the bus station, he might not have gotten in trouble. ""He'll get a second chance, won't he?"" Chiron winced. ""I'm afraid that was Grover's second chance, Percy. The council was not  anxious to give him another, either, after what happened the first time, five years ago. Olympus  knows, I advised him to wait longer before trying again. He's still so small for his age... ."" ""How old is he?"" ""Oh, twenty-eight."" ""What! And he's in sixth grade?"" ""Satyrs mature half as fast as humans, Percy. Grover has been the equivalent of a middle  school student for the past six years."" ""That's horrible."" ""Quite,"" Chiron agreed. ""At any rate, Grover is a late bloomer, even by satyr standards, and  not yet very accomplished at woodland magic. Alas, he was anxious to pursue his dream. Perhaps  now he will find some other career... ."" ""That's not fair,"" I said. ""What happened the first time? Was it really so bad?"" Chiron looked away quickly. ""Let's move along, shall we?"" But I wasn't quite ready to let the subject drop. Something had occurred to me when Chiron  talked about my mother's fate, as if he were intentionally avoiding the word death. The  beginnings of an idea—a tiny, hopeful fire—started forming in my mind. ""Chiron,"" I said. ""If the gods and Olympus and all that are real ..."" ""Yes, child?"" ""Does that mean the Underworld is real, too?"" Chiron's expression darkened. ""Yes, child."" He paused, as if choosing his words carefully. ""There is a place where spirits go  after death. But for now ... until we know more . . . I would urge you to put that out of your  mind."" ""What do you mean, 'until we know more'?"" ""Come, Percy. Let's see the woods.""  As we got closer, I realized how huge the forest was. It took up at least a quarter of the valley,  with trees so tall and thick, you could imagine nobody had been in there since the Native  Americans. Chiron said, ""The woods are stocked, if you care to try your luck, but go armed."" ""Stocked with what?"" I asked. ""Armed with what?"" ""You'll see. Capture the flag is Friday night. Do you have your own sword and shield?"" ""My own—?"" ""No,"" Chiron said. ""I don't suppose you do. I think a size five will do. I'll visit the armory  later."" I wanted to ask what kind of summer camp had an armory, but there was too much else to  think about, so the tour continued. We saw the archery range, the canoeing lake, the stables  (which Chiron didn't seem to like very much), the javelin range, the sing-along amphitheater, and  the arena where Chiron said they held sword and spear fights. ""Sword and spear fights?"" I asked. ""Cabin challenges and all that,"" he explained. ""Not lethal. Usually. Oh, yes, and there's the  mess hall."" Chiron pointed to an outdoor pavilion framed in white Grecian columns on a hill overlooking  the sea. There were a dozen stone picnic tables. No roof. No walls. ""What do you do when it rains?"" I asked. Chiron looked at me as if I'd gone a little weird. ""We still have to eat, don't we?"" I decided to  drop the subject. Finally, he showed me the cabins. There were twelve of them, nestled in the woods by the  lake. They were arranged in a U, with two at the base and five in a row on either side. And they  were without doubt the most bizarre collection of buildings I'd ever seen. Except for the fact that each had a large brass number above the door (odds on the left side,  evens on the right), they looked absolutely nothing alike. Number nine had smokestacks, like a  tiny factory. Number four had tomato vines on the walls and a roof made out of real grass. Seven  seemed to be made of solid gold, which gleamed so much in the sunlight it was almost impossible  to look at. They all faced a commons area about the size of a soccer field, dotted with Greek  statues, fountains, flower beds, and a couple of basketball hoops (which were more my speed). In the center of the field was a huge stone-lined firepit. Even though it was a warm afternoon,  the hearth smoldered. A girl about nine years old was tending the flames, poking the coals with a  stick. The pair of cabins at the head of the field, numbers one and two, looked like his-and-hers  mausoleums, big white marble boxes with heavy columns in front. Cabin one was the biggest and  bulkiest of the twelve. Its polished bronze doors shimmered like a hologram, so that from  different angles lightning bolts seemed to streak across them. Cabin two was more graceful  somehow, with slimmer columns garlanded with pomegranates and flowers. The walls were  carved with images of peacocks. ""Zeus and Hera?"" I guessed. ""Correct,"" Chiron said. ""Their cabins look empty."" ""Several of the cabins are. That's true. No one ever stays in one or two."" Okay. So each cabin had a different god, like a mascot. Twelve cabins for the twelve  Olympians. But why would some be empty? I stopped in front of the first cabin on the left, cabin three. It wasn't high and mighty like cabin one, but long and low and solid. The outer walls were of  rough gray stone studded with pieces of seashell and coral, as if the slabs had been hewn straight  from the bottom of the ocean floor. I peeked inside the open doorway and Chiron said, ""Oh, I  wouldn't do that!"" Before he could pull me back, I caught the salty scent of the interior, like the wind on the  shore at Montauk. The interior walls glowed like abalone. There were six empty bunk beds with  silk sheets turned down. But there was no sign anyone had ever slept there. The place felt so sad  and lonely, I was glad when Chiron put his hand on my shoulder and said, ""Come along, Percy."" Most of the other cabins were crowded with campers. Number five was bright red—a real nasty paint job, as if the color had been splashed on with  buckets and fists. The roof was lined with barbed wire. A stuffed wild boar's head hung over the  doorway, and its eyes seemed to follow me. Inside I could see a bunch of mean-looking kids,  both girls and boys, arm wrestling and arguing with each other while rock music blared. The  loudest was a girl maybe thirteen or fourteen. She wore a size XXXL CAMP HALF-BLOOD T shirt under a camouflage jacket. She zeroed in on me and gave me an evil sneer. She reminded  me of Nancy Bobofit, though the camper girl was much bigger and tougher looking, and her hair  was long and stringy, and brown instead of red. I kept walking, trying to stay clear of Chiron's hooves. ""We haven't seen any other centaurs,""  I observed. ""No,"" said Chiron sadly. ""My kinsmen are a wild and barbaric folk, I'm afraid. You might  encounter them in the wilderness, or at major sporting events. But you won't see any here."" ""You said your name was Chiron. Are you really ..."" He smiled down at me. ""The Chiron from the stories? Trainer of Hercules and all that? Yes,  Percy, I am."" ""But, shouldn't you be dead?"" Chiron paused, as if the question intrigued him. ""I honestly don't know about should be. The  truth is, I can't be dead. You see, eons ago the gods granted my wish. I could continue the work I  loved. I could be a teacher of heroes as long as humanity needed me. I gained much from that  wish ... and I gave up much. But I'm still here, so I can only assume I'm still needed."" I thought about being a teacher for three thousand years. It wouldn't have made my Top Ten  Things to Wish For list. ""Doesn't it ever get boring?"" ""No, no,"" he said. ""Horribly depressing, at times, but never boring."" ""Why depressing?"" Chiron seemed to turn hard of hearing again. ""Oh, look,"" he said. ""Annabeth is waiting for us.""   * * *  The blond girl I'd met at the Big House was reading a book in front of the last cabin on the left,  number eleven. When we reached her, she looked me over critically, like she was still thinking about how  much I drooled. I tried to see what she was reading, but I couldn't make out the title. I thought my dyslexia  was acting up. Then I realized the title wasn't even English. The letters looked Greek to me. I  mean, literally Greek. There were pictures of temples and statues and different kinds of columns,  like those in an architecture book. ""Annabeth,"" Chiron said, ""I have masters' archery class at noon. Would you take Percy from  here?"" ""Yes, sir."" ""Cabin eleven,"" Chiron told me, gesturing toward the doorway. ""Make yourself at home."" Out of all the cabins, eleven looked the most like a regular old summer camp cabin, with the  emphasis on old. The threshold was worn down, the brown paint peeling. Over the doorway was one of those doctor's symbols, a winged pole with two snakes wrapped around it. What did they  call it... ? A caduceus. Inside, it was packed with people, both boys and girls, way more than the number of bunk  beds. Sleeping bags were spread all over on the floor. It looked like a gym where the Red Cross  had set up an evacuation center. Chiron didn't go in. The door was too low for him. But when the campers saw him they all  stood and bowed respectfully.  ""Well, then,"" Chiron said. ""Good luck, Percy. I'll see you at dinner."" He galloped away toward the archery range. I stood in the doorway, looking at the kids. They weren't bowing anymore. They were staring  at me, sizing me up. I knew this routine. I'd gone through it at enough schools. ""Well?"" Annabeth prompted. ""Go on."" So naturally I tripped coming in the door and made a total fool of myself. There were some  snickers from the campers, but none of them said anything. Annabeth announced, ""Percy Jackson, meet cabin eleven. ""Regular or undetermined?"" somebody asked. I didn't know what to say, but Annabeth said, ""Undetermined."" Everybody groaned. A guy who was a little older than the rest came forward. ""Now, now, campers. That's what  we're here for. Welcome, Percy. You can have that spot on the floor, right over there."" The guy was about nineteen, and he looked pretty cool. He was tall and muscular, with short cropped sandy hair and a friendly smile. He wore an orange tank top, cutoffs, sandals, and a  leather necklace with five different-colored clay beads. The only thing unsettling about his  appearance was a thick white scar that ran from just beneath his right eye to his jaw, like an old  knife slash. ""This is Luke,"" Annabeth said, and her voice sounded different somehow. I glanced over and  could've sworn she was blushing. She saw me looking, and her expression hardened again. ""He's  your counselor for now."" ""For now?"" I asked. ""You're undetermined,"" Luke explained patiently. ""They don't know what cabin to put you in,  so you're here. Cabin eleven takes all newcomers, all visitors. Naturally, we would. Hermes, our  patron, is the god of travelers."" I looked at the tiny section of floor they'd given me. I had nothing to put there to mark it as  my own, no luggage, no clothes, no sleeping bag. Just the Minotaur's horn. I thought about setting  that down, but then I remembered that Hermes was also the god of thieves. I looked around at the campers' faces, some sullen and suspicious, some grinning stupidly,  some eyeing me as if they were waiting for a chance to pick my pockets. ""How long will I be here?"" I asked. ""Good question,"" Luke said. ""Until you're determined."" ""How long will that take?"" The campers all laughed. ""Come on,"" Annabeth told me. ""I'll show you the volleyball court."" ""I've already seen it."" ""Come on."" She grabbed my wrist and dragged me outside. I could hear the kids of cabin  eleven laughing behind me. When we were a few feet away, Annabeth said, ""Jackson, you have to do better than that."" ""What?"" She rolled her eyes and mumbled under her breath, ""I can't believe I thought you were the  one."" ""What's your problem?"" I was getting angry now. ""All I know is, I kill some bull guy—"" ""Don't talk like that!"" Annabeth told me. ""You know how many kids at this camp wish they'd  had your chance?"" ""To get killed?"" ""To fight the Minotaur! What do you think we train for?"" I shook my head. ""Look, if the thing I fought really was the Minotaur, the same one in the  stories ..."" ""Yes."" ""Then there's only one."" ""Yes."" ""And he died, like, a gajillion years ago, right? Theseus killed him in the labyrinth. So ..."" ""Monsters don't die, Percy. They can be killed. But they don't die."" ""Oh, thanks. That clears it up."" ""They don't have souls, like you and me. You can dispel them for a while, maybe even for a  whole lifetime if you're lucky. But they are primal forces. Chiron calls them archetypes.  Eventually, they re-form."" I thought about Mrs. Dodds. ""You mean if I killed one, accidentally, with a sword—"" ""The Fur ... I mean, your math teacher. That's right. She's still out there. You just made her  very, very mad."" ""How did you know about Mrs. Dodds?"" ""You talk in your sleep."" ""You almost called her something. A Fury? They're Hades' torturers, right?"" Annabeth glanced nervously at the ground, as if she expected it to open up and swallow her.  ""You shouldn't call them by name, even here. We call them the Kindly Ones, if we have to speak  of them at all."" ""Look, is there anything we can say without it thundering?"" I sounded whiny, even to myself,  but right then I didn't care. ""Why do I have to stay in cabin eleven, anyway? Why is everybody so  crowded together? There are plenty of empty bunks right over there."" I pointed to the first few cabins, and Annabeth turned pale. ""You don't just choose a cabin,  Percy. It depends on who your parents are. Or ... your parent."" She stared at me, waiting for me to get it. ""My mom is Sally Jackson,"" I said. ""She works at the candy store in Grand Central Station.  At least, she used to."" ""I'm sorry about your mom, Percy. But that's not what I mean. I'm talking about your other  parent. Your dad."" ""He's dead. I never knew him."" Annabeth sighed. Clearly, she'd had this conversation before with other kids. ""Your father's  not dead, Percy."" ""How can you say that? You know him?"" ""No, of course not."" ""Then how can you say—"" ""Because I know you. You wouldn't be here if you weren't one of us."" ""You don't know anything about me."" ""No?"" She raised an eyebrow. ""I bet you moved around from school to school. I bet you were  kicked out of a lot of them."" ""How—"" ""Diagnosed with dyslexia. Probably ADHD, too."" I tried to swallow my embarrassment. ""What does that have to do with anything?"" ""Taken together, it's almost a sure sign. The letters float off the page when you read, right?  That's because your mind is hardwired for ancient Greek. And the ADHD—you're impulsive,  can't sit still in the classroom. That's your battlefield reflexes. In a real fight, they'd keep you alive. As for the attention problems, that's because you see too much, Percy, not too little. Your  senses are better than a regular mortal's. Of course the teachers want you medicated. Most of  them are monsters. They don't want you seeing them for what they are."" ""You sound like ... you went through the same thing?"" ""Most of the kids here did. If you weren't like us, you couldn't have survived the Minotaur,  much less the ambrosia and nectar."" ""Ambrosia and nectar."" ""The food and drink we were giving you to make you better. That stuff would've killed a  normal kid. It would've turned your blood to fire and your bones to sand and you'd be dead. Face  it. You're a half-blood."" A half-blood.  I was reeling with so many questions I didn't know where to start. Then a husky voice yelled, ""Well! A newbie!"" I looked over. The big girl from the ugly red cabin was sauntering toward us. She had three  other girls behind her, all big and ugly and mean looking like her, all wearing camo jackets. ""Clarisse,"" Annabeth sighed. ""Why don't you go polish your spear or something?"" ""Sure, Miss Princess,"" the big girl said. ""So I can run you through with it Friday night."" ''Erre es korakas!"" Annabeth said, which I somehow understood was Greek for 'Go to the  crows!' though I had a feeling it was a worse curse than it sounded. ""You don't stand a chance."" ""We'll pulverize you,"" Clarisse said, but her eye twitched. Perhaps she wasn't sure she could  follow through on the threat. She turned toward me. ""Who's this little runt?"" ""Percy Jackson,"" Annabeth said, ""meet Clarisse, Daughter of Ares."" I blinked. ""Like ... the war god?"" Clarisse sneered. ""You got a problem with that?"" ""No,"" I said, recovering my wits. ""It explains the bad smell."" Clarisse growled. ""We got an initiation ceremony for newbies, Prissy."" ""Percy."" ""Whatever. Come on, I'll show you."" ""Clarisse—"" Annabeth tried to say. ""Stay out of it, wise girl."" Annabeth looked pained, but she did stay out of it, and I didn't really want her help. I was the  new kid. I had to earn my own rep. I handed Annabeth my minotaur horn and got ready to fight, but before I knew it, Clarisse  had me by the neck and was dragging me toward a cinder-block building that I knew immediately  was the bathroom. I was kicking and punching. I'd been in plenty of fights before, but this big girl Clarisse had  hands like iron. She dragged me into the girls' bathroom. There was a line of toilets on one side  and a line of shower stalls down the other. It smelled just like any public bathroom, and I was  thinking—as much as I could think with Clarisse ripping my hair out—that if this place belonged  to the gods, they should've been able to afford classier johns. Clarisse's friends were all laughing, and I was trying to find the strength I'd used to fight the  Minotaur, but it just wasn't there. ""Like he's 'Big Three' material,"" Clarisse said as she pushed me toward one of the toilets.  ""Yeah, right. Minotaur probably fell over laughing, he was so stupid looking."" Her friends snickered. Annabeth stood in the corner, watching through her fingers. Clarisse bent me over on my knees and started pushing my head toward the toilet bowl. It  reeked like rusted pipes and, well, like what goes into toilets. I strained to keep my head up. I was  looking at the scummy water, thinking, I will not go into that. I won't. Then something happened. I felt a tug in the pit of my stomach. I heard the plumbing rumble,  the pipes shudder. Clarisse's grip on my hair loosened. Water shot out of the toilet, making an arc  straight over my head, and the next thing I knew, I was sprawled on the bathroom tiles with  Clarisse screaming behind me. I turned just as water blasted out of the toilet again, hitting Clarisse straight in the face so  hard it pushed her down onto her butt. The water stayed on her like the spray from a fire hose,  pushing her backward into a shower stall. She struggled, gasping, and her friends started coming toward her. But then the other toilets  exploded, too, and six more streams of toilet water blasted them back. The showers acted up, too,  and together all the fixtures sprayed the camouflage girls right out of the bathroom, spinning them  around like pieces of garbage being washed away. As soon as they were out the door, I felt the tug in my gut lessen, and the water shut off as  quickly as it had started. The entire bathroom was flooded. Annabeth hadn't been spared. She was dripping wet, but  she hadn't been pushed out the door. She was standing in exactly the same place, staring at me in  shock. I looked down and realized I was sitting in the only dry spot in the whole room. There was a  circle of dry floor around me. I didn't have one drop of water on my clothes. Nothing. I stood up, my legs shaky. Annabeth said, ""How did you ..."" ""I don't know."" We walked to the door. Outside, Clarisse and her friends were sprawled in the mud, and a  bunch of other campers had gathered around to gawk. Clarisse's hair was flattened across her  face. Her camouflage jacket was sopping and she smelled like sewage. She gave me a look of  absolute hatred. ""You are dead, new boy. You are totally dead."" I probably should have let it go, but I said, ""You want to gargle with toilet water again,  Clarisse? Close your mouth."" Her friends had to hold her back. They dragged her toward cabin five, while the other  campers made way to avoid her flailing feet. Annabeth stared at me. I couldn't tell whether she was just grossed out or angry at me for  dousing her. ""What?"" I demanded. ""What are you thinking?"" ""I'm thinking,"" she said, ""that I want you on my team for capture the flag."""
Percy Jackson 1 Chapter 7,"Word of the bathroom incident spread immediately. Wherever I went, campers pointed at me and  murmured something about toilet water. Or maybe they were just staring at Annabeth, who was  still pretty much dripping wet. She showed me a few more places: the metal shop (where kids were forging their own  swords), the arts-and-crafts room (where satyrs were sandblasting a giant marble statue of a goat man), and the climbing wall, which actually consisted of two facing walls that shook violently,  dropped boulders, sprayed lava, and clashed together if you didn't get to the top fast enough. Finally we returned to the canoeing lake, where the trail led back to the cabins. ""I've got training to do,"" Annabeth said flatly. ""Dinner's at seven-thirty. Just follow your  cabin to the mess hall."" ""Annabeth, I'm sorry about the toilets."" ""Whatever."" ""It wasn't my fault."" She looked at me skeptically, and I realized it was my fault. I'd made water shoot out of the  bathroom fixtures. I didn't understand how. But the toilets had responded to me. I had become  one with the plumbing. ""You need to talk to the Oracle,"" Annabeth said. ""Who?"" ""Not who. What. The Oracle. I'll ask Chiron."" I stared into the lake, wishing somebody would give me a straight answer for once. I wasn't expecting anybody to be looking back at me from the bottom, so my heart skipped a  beat when I noticed two teenage girls sitting cross-legged at the base of the pier, about twenty  feet below. They wore blue jeans and shimmering green T-shirts, and their brown hair floated  loose around their shoulders as minnows darted in and out. They smiled and waved as if I were a  long-lost friend. I didn't know what else to do. I waved back. ""Don't encourage them,"" Annabeth warned. ""Naiads are terrible flirts."" ""Naiads,"" I repeated, feeling completely overwhelmed. ""That's it. I want to go home now."" Annabeth frowned. ""Don't you get it, Percy? You are home. This is the only safe place on  earth for kids like us."" ""You mean, mentally disturbed kids?"" ""I mean not human. Not totally human, anyway. Half-human."" ""Half-human and half-what?"" ""I think you know."" I didn't want to admit it, but I was afraid I did. I felt a tingling in my limbs, a sensation I  sometimes felt when my mom talked about my dad. ""God,"" I said. ""Half-god."" Annabeth nodded. ""Your father isn't dead, Percy. He's one of the Olympians."" ""That's ... crazy."" ""Is it? What's the most common thing gods did in the old stories? They ran around falling in  love with humans and having kids with them. Do you think they've changed their habits in the  last few millennia?"" ""But those are just—"" I almost said myths again. Then I remembered Chiron's warning that in  two thousand years, I might be considered a myth. ""But if all the kids here are half-gods—"" ""Demigods,"" Annabeth said. ""That's the official term. Or half-bloods."" ""Then who's your dad?"" Her hands tightened around the pier railing. I got the feeling I'd just trespassed on a sensitive  subject. ""My dad is a professor at West Point,"" she said. ""I haven't seen him since I was very small.  He teaches American history."" ""He's human."" ""What? You assume it has to be a male god who finds a human female attractive? How sexist  is that?"" ""Who's your mom, then?"" ""Cabin six."" ""Meaning?"" Annabeth straightened. ""Athena. Goddess of wisdom and battle."" Okay, I thought. Why not? ""And my dad?"" ""Undetermined,"" Annabeth said, ""like I told you before. Nobody knows."" ""Except my mother. She knew."" ""Maybe not, Percy. Gods don't always reveal their identities."" ""My dad would have. He loved her."" Annabeth gave me a cautious look. She didn't want to burst my bubble. ""Maybe you're right.  Maybe he'll send a sign. That's the only way to know for sure: your father has to send you a sign  claiming you as his son. Sometimes it happens. ""You mean sometimes it doesn't?"" Annabeth ran her palm along the rail. ""The gods are busy. They have a lot of kids and they  don't always ... Well, sometimes they don't care about us, Percy. They ignore us."" I thought about some of the kids I'd seen in the Hermes cabin, teenagers who looked sullen  and depressed, as if they were waiting for a call that would never come. I'd known kids like that  at Yancy Academy, shuffled off to boarding school by rich parents who didn't have the time to  deal with them. But gods should behave better. ""So I'm stuck here,"" I said. ""That's it? For the rest of my life?"" ""It depends,"" Annabeth said. ""Some campers only stay the summer. If you're a child of  Aphrodite or Demeter, you're probably not a real powerful force. The monsters might ignore you,  so you can get by with a few months of summer training and live in the mortal world the rest of  the year. But for some of us, it's too dangerous to leave. We're year-rounders. In the mortal world,  we attract monsters. They sense us. They come to challenge us. Most of the time, they'll ignore us  until we're old enough to cause trouble—about ten or eleven years old, but after that, most  demigods either make their way here, or they get killed off. A few manage to survive in the  outside world and become famous. Believe me, if I told you the names, you'd know them. Some  don't even realize they're demigods. But very, very few are like that."" ""So monsters can't get in here?"" Annabeth shook her head. ""Not unless they're intentionally stocked in the woods or specially  summoned by somebody on the inside."" ""Why would anybody want to summon a monster?"" ""Practice fights. Practical jokes."" ""Practical jokes?"" ""The point is, the borders are sealed to keep mortals and monsters out. From the outside,  mortals look into the valley and see nothing unusual, just a strawberry farm."" ""So ... you're a year-rounder?"" Annabeth nodded. From under the collar of her T-shirt she pulled a leather necklace with five  clay beads of different colors. It was just like Luke's, except Annabeth's also had a big gold ring  strung on it, like a college ring. ""I've been here since I was seven,"" she said. ""Every August, on the last day of summer  session, you get a bead for surviving another year. I've been here longer than most of the  counselors, and they're all in college."" ""Why did you come so young?"" She twisted the ring on her necklace. ""None of your business."" ""Oh."" I stood there for a minute in uncomfortable silence. ""So ... I could just walk out of here  right now if I wanted to?"" ""It would be suicide, but you could, with Mr. D's or Chiron's permission. But they wouldn't  give permission until the end of the summer session unless ..."" ""Unless?"" ""You were granted a quest. But that hardly ever happens. The last time ..."" Her voice trailed off. I could tell from her tone that the last time hadn't gone well. ""Back in the sick room,"" I said, ""when you were feeding me that stuff—"" ""Ambrosia."" ""Yeah. You asked me something about the summer solstice."" Annabeth's shoulders tensed. ""So you do know something?"" ""Well... no. Back at my old school, I overheard Grover and Chiron talking about it. Grover  mentioned the summer solstice. He said something like we didn't have much time, because of the  deadline. What did that mean?"" She clenched her fists. ""I wish I knew. Chiron and the satyrs, they know, but they won't tell  me. Something is wrong in Olympus, something pretty major. Last time I was there, everything  seemed so normal."" ""You've been to Olympus?"" ""Some of us year-rounders—Luke and Clarisse and I and a few others—we took a field trip  during winter solstice. That's when the gods have their big annual council."" ""But... how did you get there?"" ""The Long Island Railroad, of course. You get off at Penn Station. Empire State Building,  special elevator to the six hundredth floor."" She looked at me like she was sure I must know this  already. ""You are a New Yorker, right?"" ""Oh, sure."" As far as I knew, there were only a hundred and two floors in the Empire State  Building, but I decided not to point that out. ""Right after we visited,"" Annabeth continued, ""the weather got weird, as if the gods had  started fighting. A couple of times since, I've overheard satyrs talking. The best I can figure out is  that something important was stolen. And if it isn't returned by summer solstice, there's going to  be trouble. When you came, I was hoping ... I mean— Athena can get along with just about  anybody, except for Ares. And of course she's got the rivalry with Poseidon. But, I mean, aside  from that, I thought we could work together. I thought you might know something."" I shook my head. I wished I could help her, but I felt too hungry and tired and mentally  overloaded to ask any more questions. ""I've got to get a quest,"" Annabeth muttered to herself. ""I'm not too young. If they would just  tell me the problem ..."" I could smell barbecue smoke coming from somewhere nearby. Annabeth must've heard my  stomach growl. She told me to go on, she'd catch me later. I left her on the pier, tracing her finger  across the rail as if drawing a battle plan. Back at cabin eleven, everybody was talking and horsing around, waiting for dinner. For the first  time, I noticed that a lot of the campers had similar features: sharp noses, upturned eyebrows,  mischievous smiles. They were the kind of kids that teachers would peg as troublemakers.  Thankfully, nobody paid much attention to me as I walked over to my spot on the floor and  plopped down with my minotaur horn.  The counselor, Luke, came over. He had the Hermes family resemblance, too. It was marred  by that scar on his right cheek, but his smile was intact. ""Found you a sleeping bag,"" he said. ""And here, I stole you some toiletries from the camp  store."" I couldn't tell if he was kidding about the stealing part. I said, ""Thanks."" ""No prob."" Luke sat next to me, pushed his back against the wall. ""Tough first day?"" ""I don't belong here,"" I said. ""I don't even believe in gods."" ""Yeah,"" he said. ""That's how we all started. Once you start believing in them? It doesn't get  any easier."" The bitterness in his voice surprised me, because Luke seemed like a pretty easygoing guy.  He looked like he could handle just about anything. ""So your dad is Hermes?"" I asked. He pulled a switchblade out of his back pocket, and for a second I thought he was going to  gut me, but he just scraped the mud off the sole of his sandal. ""Yeah. Hermes."" ""The wing-footed messenger guy."" ""That's him. Messengers. Medicine. Travelers, merchants, thieves. Anybody who uses the  roads. That's why you're here, enjoying cabin eleven's hospitality. Hermes isn't picky about who  he sponsors."" I figured Luke didn't mean to call me a nobody. He just had a lot on his mind. ""You ever meet your dad?"" I asked. ""Once."" I waited, thinking that if he wanted to tell me, he'd tell me. Apparently, he didn't. I wondered  if the story had anything to do with how he got his scar. Luke looked up and managed a smile. ""Don't worry about it, Percy. The campers here, they're  mostly good people. After all, we're extended family, right? We take care of each other."" He seemed to understand how lost I felt, and I was grateful for that, because an older guy like  him—even if he was a counselor—should've steered clear of an uncool middle-schooler like me.  But Luke had welcomed me into the cabin. He'd even stolen me some toiletries, which was the  nicest thing anybody had done for me all day. I decided to ask him my last big question, the one that had been bothering me all afternoon.  ""Clarisse, from Ares, was joking about me being 'Big Three' material. Then Annabeth ... twice,  she said I might be 'the one.' She said I should talk to the Oracle. What was that all about?"" Luke folded his knife. ""I hate prophecies."" ""What do you mean?"" His face twitched around the scar. ""Let's just say I messed things up for everybody else. The  last two years, ever since my trip to the Garden of the Hesperides went sour, Chiron hasn't  allowed any more quests. Annabeth's been dying to get out into the world. She pestered Chiron so  much he finally told her he already knew her fate. He'd had a prophecy from the Oracle. He  wouldn't tell her the whole thing, but he said Annabeth wasn't destined to go on a quest yet. She  had to wait until... somebody special came to the camp."" ""Somebody special?"" ""Don't worry about it, kid,"" Luke said. ""Annabeth wants to think every new camper who  comes through here is the omen she's been waiting for. Now, come on, it's dinnertime."" The moment he said it, a horn blew in the distance. Somehow, I knew it was a conch shell,  even though I'd never heard one before. Luke yelled, ""Eleven, fall in!"" The whole cabin, about twenty of us, filed into the commons yard. We lined up in order of  seniority, so of course I was dead last. Campers came from the other cabins, too, except for the  three empty cabins at the end, and cabin eight, which had looked normal in the daytime, but was  now starting to glow silver as the sun went down. We marched up the hill to the mess hall pavilion. Satyrs joined us from the meadow. Naiads  emerged from the canoeing lake. A few other girls came out of the woods— and when I say out  of the woods, I mean straight out of the woods. I saw one girl, about nine or ten years old, melt  from the side of a maple tree and come skipping up the hill. In all, there were maybe a hundred campers, a few dozen satyrs, and a dozen assorted wood  nymphs and naiads. At the pavilion, torches blazed around the marble columns. A central fire burned in a bronze  brazier the size of a bathtub. Each cabin had its own table, covered in white cloth trimmed in  purple. Four of the tables were empty, but cabin eleven's was way overcrowded. I had to squeeze  on to the edge of a bench with half my butt hanging off. I saw Grover sitting at table twelve with Mr. D, a few satyrs, and a couple of plump blond  boys who looked just like Mr. D. Chiron stood to one side, the picnic table being way too small  for a centaur. Annabeth sat at table six with a bunch of serious-looking athletic kids, all with her gray eyes  and honey-blond hair. Clarisse sat behind me at Ares's table. She'd apparently gotten over being hosed down,  because she was laughing and belching right alongside her friends. Finally, Chiron pounded his hoof against the marble floor of the pavilion, and everybody fell  silent. He raised a glass. ""To the gods!"" Everybody else raised their glasses. ""To the gods!"" Wood nymphs came forward with platters of food: grapes, apples, strawberries, cheese, fresh  bread, and yes, barbecue! My glass was empty, but Luke said, ""Speak to it. Whatever you want— nonalcoholic, of course."" I said, ""Cherry Coke."" The glass filled with sparkling caramel liquid. Then I had an idea. ""Blue Cherry Coke."" The soda turned a violent shade of cobalt. I took a cautious sip. Perfect.  I drank a toast to my mother. She's not gone, I told myself. Not permanently, anyway. She's in the Underworld. And if  that's a real place, then someday... ""Here you go, Percy,"" Luke said, handing me a platter of smoked brisket. I loaded my plate and was about to take a big bite when I noticed everybody getting up,  carrying their plates toward the fire in the center of the pavilion. I wondered if they were going  for dessert or something. ""Come on,"" Luke told me. As I got closer, I saw that everyone was taking a portion of their meal and dropping it into the  fire, the ripest strawberry, the juiciest slice of beef, the warmest, most buttery roll. Luke murmured in my ear, ""Burnt offerings for the gods. They like the smell."" ""You're kidding."" His look warned me not to take this lightly, but I couldn't help wondering why an immortal,  all-powerful being would like the smell of burning food. Luke approached the fire, bowed his head, and tossed in a cluster of fat red grapes. ""Hermes."" I was next. I wished I knew what god's name to say.  Finally, I made a silent plea. Whoever you are, tell me. Please.  I scraped a big slice of brisket into the flames.  When I caught a whiff of the smoke, I didn't gag.  It smelled nothing like burning food. It smelled of hot chocolate and fresh-baked brownies, hamburgers on the grill and wildflowers, and a hundred other good things that shouldn't have gone well together, but did. I could almost believe the gods could live off that smoke.  When everybody had returned to their seats and finished eating their meals, Chiron pounded his hoof again for our attention.  Mr. D got up with a huge sigh. ""Yes, I suppose I'd better say hello to all you brats. Well, hello. Our activities director, Chiron, says the next capture the flag is Friday. Cabin five presently holds the laurels.""  A bunch of ugly cheering rose from the Ares table.  ""Personally,"" Mr. D continued, ""I couldn't care less, but congratulations. Also, I should tell you that we have a new camper today. Peter Johnson.""  Chiron murmured something.  ""Er, Percy Jackson,"" Mr. D corrected. ""That's right. Hurrah, and all that. Now run along to your silly campfire. Go on.""  Everybody cheered. We all headed down toward the amphitheater, where Apollo's cabin led a sing-along. We sang camp songs about the gods and ate s'mores and joked around, and the funny thing was, I didn't feel that anyone was staring at me anymore. I felt that I was home.  Later in the evening, when the sparks from the campfire were curling into a starry sky, the conch horn blew again, and we all filed back to our cabins. I didn't realize how exhausted I was until I collapsed on my borrowed sleeping bag.    My fingers curled around the Minotaur's horn. I thought about my mom, but I had good thoughts: her smile, the bedtime stories she would read me when I was a kid, the way she would tell me not to let the bedbugs bite.  When I closed my eyes, I fell asleep instantly.  That was my first day at CampHalf-Blood.  I wish I'd known how briefly I would get to enjoy my new home."
Percy Jackson 1 Chapter 8,"The next few days I settled into a routine that felt almost normal, if you don't count the fact that I was getting lessons from satyrs, nymphs, and a centaur.  Each morning I took Ancient Greek from Annabeth, and we talked about the gods and goddesses in the present tense, which was kind of weird. I discovered Annabeth was right about my dyslexia: Ancient Greek wasn't that hard for me to read. At least, no harder than English. After a couple of mornings, I could stumble through a few lines of Homer without too much headache.  The rest of the day, I'd rotate through outdoor activities, looking for something I was good at. Chiron tried to teach me archery, but we found out pretty quick I wasn't any good with a bow and arrow. He didn't complain, even when he had to desnag a stray arrow out of his tail.  Foot racing? No good either. The wood-nymph instructors left me in the dust. They told me not to worry about it. They'd had centuries of practice running away from lovesick gods. But still, it was a little humiliating to be slower than a tree.  And wrestling? Forget it. Every time I got on the mat, Clarisse would pulverize me.  ""There's more where that came from, punk,"" she'd mumble in my ear.  The only thing I really excelled at was canoeing, and that wasn't the kind of heroic skill people expected to see from the kid who had beaten the Minotaur.  I knew the senior campers and counselors were watching me, trying to decide who my dad was, but they weren't having an easy time of it. I wasn't as strong as the Ares kids, or as good at archery as the Apollo kids. I didn't have Hephaestus's skill with metalwork or—gods forbid— Dionysus's way with vine plants. Luke told me I might be a child of Hermes, a kind of jack-of-all-trades, master of none. But I got the feeling he was just trying to make me feel better. He really didn't know what to make of me either.  Despite all that, I liked camp. I got used to the morning fog over the beach, the smell of hot strawberry fields in the afternoon, even the weird noises of monsters in the woods at night. I would eat dinner with cabin eleven, scrape part of my meal into the fire, and try to feel some connection to my real dad. Nothing came. Just that warm feeling I'd always had, like the memory of his smile. I tried not to think too much about my mom, but I kept wondering: if gods and monsters were real, if all this magical stuff was possible, surely there was some way to save her, to bring her back....  I started to understand Luke's bitterness and how he seemed to resent his father, Hermes. So okay, maybe gods had important things to do. But couldn't they call once in a while, or thunder, or something? Dionysus could make Diet Coke appear out of thin air. Why couldn't my dad, whoever he was, make a phone appear?  Thursday afternoon, three days after I'd arrived at CampHalf-Blood, I had my first sword-fighting lesson. Everybody from cabin eleven gathered in the big circular arena, where Luke would be our instructor.  We started with basic stabbing and slashing, using some straw-stuffed dummies in Greek armor. I guess I did okay. At least, I understood what I was supposed to do and my reflexes were good.  The problem was, I couldn't find a blade that felt right in my hands. Either they were too heavy, or too light, or too long. Luke tried his best to fix me up, but he agreed that none of the practice blades seemed to work for me.  We moved on to dueling in pairs. Luke announced he would be my partner, since this was my first time.  ""Good luck,"" one of the campers told me. ""Luke's the best swordsman in the last three hundred years.""  ""Maybe he'll go easy on me,"" I said.  The camper snorted.  Luke showed me thrusts and parries and shield blocks the hard way. With every swipe, I got a little more battered and bruised. ""Keep your guard up, Percy,"" he'd say, then whap me in the ribs with the flat of his blade. ""No, not that far up!"" Whap! ""Lunge!"" Whap! ""Now, back!"" Whap!  By the time he called a break, I was soaked in sweat. Everybody swarmed the drinks cooler. Luke poured ice water on his head, which looked like such a good idea, I did the same.  Instantly, I felt better. Strength surged back into my arms. The sword didn't feel so awkward.  ""Okay, everybody circle up!"" Luke ordered. ""If Percy doesn't mind, I want to give you a little demo.""  Great, I thought. Let's all watch Percy get pounded.  The Hermes guys gathered around. They were suppressing smiles. I figured they'd been in my shoes before and couldn't wait to see how Luke used me for a punching bag. He told everybody he was going to demonstrate a disarming technique: how to twist the enemy's blade with the flat of your own sword so that he had no choice but to drop his weapon.  ""This is difficult,"" he stressed. ""I've had it used against me. No laughing at Percy, now. Most swordsmen have to work years to master this technique.""  He demonstrated the move on me in slow motion. Sure enough, the sword clattered out of my hand.  ""Now in real time,"" he said, after I'd retrieved my weapon. ""We keep sparring until one of us pulls it off. Ready, Percy?""  I nodded, and Luke came after me. Somehow, I kept him from getting a shot at the hilt of my sword. My senses opened up. I saw his attacks coming. I countered. I stepped forward and tried a thrust of my own. Luke deflected it easily, but I saw a change in his face. His eyes narrowed, and he started to press me with more force.  The sword grew heavy in my hand. The balance wasn't right. I knew it was only a matter of seconds before Luke took me down, so I figured, What the heck?  I tried the disarming maneuver.  My blade hit the base of Luke's and I twisted, putting my whole weight into a downward thrust.  Clang.  Luke's sword rattled against the stones. The tip of my blade was an inch from his undefended chest.  The other campers were silent.  I lowered my sword. ""Um, sorry.""  For a moment, Luke was too stunned to speak.  ""Sorry?"" His scarred face broke into a grin. ""By the gods, Percy, why are you sorry? Show me that again!""  I didn't want to. The short burst of manic energy had completely abandoned me. But Luke insisted.  This time, there was no contest. The moment our swords connected, Luke hit my hilt and sent my weapon skidding across the floor.  After a long pause, somebody in the audience said, ""Beginner's luck?""  Luke wiped the sweat off his brow. He appraised at me with an entirely new interest. ""Maybe,"" he said. ""But I wonder what Percy could do with a balanced sword... .""  Friday afternoon, I was sitting with Grover at the lake, resting from a near-death experience on the climbing wall. Grover had scampered to the top like a mountain goat, but the lava had almost gotten me. My shirt had smoking holes in it. The hairs had been singed off my forearms.  We sat on the pier, watching the naiads do underwater basket-weaving, until I got up the nerve to ask Grover how his conversation had gone with Mr. D.  His face turned a sickly shade of yellow.  ""Fine,"" he said. ""Just great.""  ""So your career's still on track?""  He glanced at me nervously. ""Chiron t-told you I want a searcher's license?""  ""Well... no."" I had no idea what a searcher's license was, but it didn't seem like the right time to ask. ""He just said you had big plans, you know ... and that you needed credit for completing a keeper's assignment. So did you get it?"" Grover looked down at the naiads. ""Mr. D suspended judgment. He said I hadn't failed or succeeded with you yet, so our fates were still tied together. If you got a quest and I went along to protect you, and we both came back alive, then maybe he'd consider the job complete.""  My spirits lifted. ""Well, that's not so bad, right?""  ""Blaa-ha-ha! He might as well have transferred me to stable-cleaning duty. The chances of you getting a quest... and even if you did, why would you want me along?""  ""Of course I'd want you along!""  Grover stared glumly into the water. ""Basket-weaving ... Must be nice to have a useful skill.""  I tried to reassure him that he had lots of talents, but that just made him look more miserable. We talked about canoeing and swordplay for a while, then debated the pros and cons of the different gods. Finally, I asked him about the four empty cabins.  ""Number eight, the silver one, belongs to Artemis,"" he said. ""She vowed to be a maiden forever. So of course, no kids. The cabin is, you know, honorary. If she didn't have one, she'd be mad.""  ""Yeah, okay. But the other three, the ones at the end. Are those the Big Three?""  Grover tensed. We were getting close to a touchy subject. ""No. One of them, number two, is Hera's,"" he said. ""That's another honorary thing. She's the goddess of marriage, so of course she wouldn't go around having affairs with mortals. That's her husband's job. When we say the Big Three, we mean the three powerful brothers, the sons of Kronos.""  ""Zeus, Poseidon, Hades.""  ""Right. You know. After the great battle with the Titans, they took over the world from their dad and drew lots to decide who got what.""  ""Zeus got the sky,"" I remembered. ""Poseidon the sea, Hades the Underworld.""  ""Uh-huh.""  ""But Hades doesn't have a cabin here.""  ""No. He doesn't have a throne on Olympus, either. He sort of does his own thing down in the Underworld. If he did have a cabin here ..."" Grover shuddered. ""Well, it wouldn't be pleasant. Let's leave it at that.""  ""But Zeus and Poseidon—they both had, like, a bazillion kids in the myths. Why are their cabins empty?""  Grover shifted his hooves uncomfortably. ""About sixty years ago, after World War II, the Big Three agreed they wouldn't sire any more heroes. Their children were just too powerful. They were affecting the course of human events too much, causing too much carnage. World War II, you know, that was basically a fight between the sons of Zeus and Poseidon on one side, and the sons of Hades on the other. The winning side, Zeus and Poseidon, made Hades swear an oath with them: no more affairs with mortal women. They all swore on the River Styx.""  Thunder boomed.. . . . . ..  I said, ""That's the most serious oath you can make.""  Grover nodded.  ""And the brothers kept their word—no kids?""  Grover's face darkened. ""Seventeen years ago, Zeus fell off the wagon. There was this TV starlet with a big fluffy eighties hairdo—he just couldn't help himself. When their child was born, a little girl named Thalia .. . well, the River Styx is serious about promises. Zeus himself got off easy because he's immortal, but he brought a terrible fate on his daughter.""  ""But that isn't fair.' It wasn't the little girl's fault.""  Grover hesitated. ""Percy, children of the Big Three have powers greater than other half-bloods. They have a strong aura, a scent that attracts monsters. When Hades found out about the girl, he wasn't too happy about Zeus breaking his oath. Hades let the worst monsters out of Tartarus to torment Thalia. A satyr was assigned to be her keeper when she was twelve, but there was nothing he could do. He tried to escort her here with a couple of other half-bloods she'd befriended. They almost made it. They got all the way to the top of that hill.""  He pointed across the valley, to the pine tree where I'd fought the minotaur. ""All three Kindly Ones were after them, along with a horde of hellhounds. They were about to be overrun when Thalia told her satyr to take the other two half-bloods to safety while she held off the monsters. She was wounded and tired, and she didn't want to live like a hunted animal. The satyr didn't want to leave her, but he couldn't change her mind, and he had to protect the others. So Thalia made her final stand alone, at the top of that hill. As she died, Zeus took pity on her. He turned her into that pine tree. Her spirit still helps protect the borders of the valley. That's why the hill is called Half-Blood Hill.""  I stared at the pine in the distance.  The story made me feel hollow, and guilty too. A girl my age had sacrificed herself to save her friends. She had faced a whole army of monsters. Next to that, my victory over the Minotaur didn't seem like much. I wondered, if I'd acted differently, could I have saved my mother?  ""Grover,"" I said, ""have heroes really gone on quests to the Underworld?""  ""Sometimes,"" he said. ""Orpheus. Hercules. Houdini.""  ""And have they ever returned somebody from the dead?""  ""No. Never. Orpheus came close... . Percy, you're not seriously thinking—""  ""No,"" I lied. ""I was just wondering. So ... a satyr is always assigned to guard a demigod?""  Grover studied me warily. I hadn't persuaded him that I'd really dropped the Underworld idea. ""Not always. We go undercover to a lot of schools. We try to sniff out the half-bloods who have the makings of great heroes. If we find one with a very strong aura, like a child of the Big Three, we alert Chiron. He tries to keep an eye on them, since they could cause really huge problems.""  ""And you found me. Chiron said you thought I might be something special.""  Grover looked as if I'd just led him into a trap. ""I didn't... Oh, listen, don't think like that. If you were—you know—you'd never ever be allowed a quest, and I'd never get my license. You're probably a child of Hermes. Or maybe even one of the minor gods, like Nemesis, the god of revenge. Don't worry, okay?""  I got the idea he was reassuring himself more than me.  That night after dinner, there was a lot more excitement than usual.  At last, it was time for capture the flag.  When the plates were cleared away, the conch horn sounded and we all stood at our tables.  Campers yelled and cheered as Annabeth and two of her siblings ran into the pavilion carrying a silk banner. It was about ten feet long, glistening gray, with a painting of a barn owl above an olive tree. From the opposite side of the pavilion, Clarisse and her buddies ran in with another banner, of identical size, but gaudy red, painted with a bloody spear and a boar's head.  I turned to Luke and yelled over the noise, ""Those are the flags?""  ""Yeah.""  ""Ares and Athena always lead the teams?""  ""Not always,"" he said. ""But often.""  ""So, if another cabin captures one, what do you do— repaint the flag?""  He grinned. ""You'll see. First we have to get one.""  ""Whose side are we on?""  He gave me a sly look, as if he knew something I didn't. The scar on his face made him look almost evil in the torchlight. ""We've made a temporary alliance with Athena. Tonight, we get the flag from Ares. And you are going to help.""  The teams were announced. Athena had made an alliance with Apollo and Hermes, the two biggest cabins. Apparently, privileges had been traded—shower times, chore schedules, the best slots for activities—in order to win support.  Ares had allied themselves with everybody else: Dionysus, Demeter, Aphrodite, and Hephaestus. From what I'd seen, Dionysus's kids were actually good athletes, but there were only two of them. Demeter's kids had the edge with nature skills and outdoor stuff but they weren't very aggressive. Aphrodite's sons and daughters I wasn't too worried about. They mostly sat out every activity and checked their reflections in the lake and did their hair and gossiped. Hephaestus's kids weren't pretty, and there were only four of them, but they were big and burly from working in the metal shop all day. They might be a problem. That, of course, left Ares's cabin: a dozen of the biggest, ugliest, meanest kids on Long Island, or anywhere else on the planet.  Chiron hammered his hoof on the marble.  ""Heroes!"" he announced. ""You know the rules. The creek is the boundary line. The entire forest is fair game. All magic items are allowed. The banner must be prominently displayed, and have no more than two guards. Prisoners may be disarmed, but may not be bound or gagged. No killing or maiming is allowed. I will serve as referee and battlefield medic. Arm yourselves!""  He spread his hands, and the tables were suddenly covered with equipment: helmets, bronze swords, spears, oxhide shields coated in metal.  ""Whoa,"" I said. ""We're really supposed to use these?""  Luke looked at me as if I were crazy. ""Unless you want to get skewered by your friends in cabin five. Here—Chiron thought these would fit. You'll be on border patrol.""  My shield was the size of an NBA backboard, with a big caduceus in the middle. It weighed about a million pounds. I could have snowboarded on it fine, but I hoped nobody seriously expected me to run fast. My helmet, like all the helmets on Athena's side, had a blue horsehair plume on top. Ares and their allies had red plumes.  Annabeth yelled, ""Blue team, forward!""  We cheered and shook our swords and followed her down the path to the south woods. The red team yelled taunts at us as they headed off toward the north.  I managed to catch up with Annabeth without tripping over my equipment. ""Hey.""  She kept marching.  ""So what's the plan?"" I asked. ""Got any magic items you can loan me?""  Her hand drifted toward her pocket, as if she were afraid I'd stolen something.  ""Just watch Clarisse's spear,"" she said. ""You don't want that thing touching you. Otherwise, don't worry. We'll take the banner from Ares. Has Luke given you your job?""  ""Border patrol, whatever that means.""  ""It's easy. Stand by the creek, keep the reds away. Leave the rest to me. Athena always has a plan.""  She pushed ahead, leaving me in the dust.  ""Okay,"" I mumbled. ""Glad you wanted me on your team.""  It was a warm, sticky night. The woods were dark, with fireflies popping in and out of view. Annabeth stationed me next to a little creek that gurgled over some rocks, then she and the rest of the team scattered into the trees.  Standing there alone, with my big blue-feathered helmet and my huge shield, I felt like an idiot. The bronze sword, like all the swords I'd tried so far, seemed balanced wrong. The leather grip pulled on my hand like a bowling ball.  There was no way anybody would actually attack me, would they? I mean, Olympus had to have liability issues, right?  Far away, the conch horn blew. I heard whoops and yells in the woods, the clanking of metal, kids fighting. A blue-plumed ally from Apollo raced past me like a deer, leaped through the creek, and disappeared into enemy territory.  Great, I thought. I'll miss all the fun, as usual.  Then I heard a sound that sent a chill up my spine, a low canine growl, somewhere close by.  I raised my shield instinctively; I had the feeling something was stalking me.  Then the growling stopped. I felt the presence retreating. On the other side of the creek, the underbrush exploded. Five Ares warriors came yelling and screaming out of the dark.  ""Cream the punk!"" Clarisse screamed.  Her ugly pig eyes glared through the slits of her helmet. She brandished a five-foot-long spear, its barbed metal tip flickering with red light. Her siblings had only the standard-issue bronze swords—not that that made me feel any better.  They charged across the stream. There was no help in sight. I could run. Or I could defend myself against half the Ares cabin.  I managed to sidestep the first kid's swing, but these guys were not as stupid the Minotaur. They surrounded me, and Clarisse thrust at me with her spear. My shield deflected the point, but I felt a painful tingling all over my body. My hair stood on end. My shield arm went numb, and the air burned.  Electricity. Her stupid spear was electric. I fell back.  Another Ares guy slammed me in the chest with the butt of his sword and I hit the dirt.  They could've kicked me into jelly, but they were too busy laughing.  ""Give him a haircut,"" Clarisse said. ""Grab his hair.""  I managed to get to my feet. I raised my sword, but Clarisse slammed it aside with her spear as sparks flew. Now both my arms felt numb.  ""Oh, wow,"" Clarisse said. ""I'm scared of this guy. Really scared.""  ""The flag is that way,"" I told her. I wanted to sound angry, but I was afraid it didn't come out that way.  ""Yeah,"" one of her siblings said. ""But see, we don't care about the flag. We care about a guy who made our cabin look stupid.""  ""You do that without my help,"" I told them. It probably wasn't the smartest thing to say.  Two of them came at me. I backed up toward the creek, tried to raise my shield, but Clarisse was too fast. Her spear stuck me straight in the ribs. If I hadn't been wearing an armored breastplate, I would've been shish-ke-babbed. As it was, the electric point just about shocked my teeth out of my mouth. One of her cabinmates slashed his sword across my arm, leaving a good-size cut.  Seeing my own blood made me dizzy—warm and cold at the same time.  ""No maiming,"" I managed to say.  ""Oops,"" the guy said. ""Guess I lost my dessert privilege.  He pushed me into the creek and I landed with a splash. They all laughed. I figured as soon as they were through being amused, I would die. But then something happened. The water seemed to wake up my senses, as if I'd just had a bag of my mom's double-espresso jelly beans.  Clarisse and her cabinmates came into the creek to get me, but I stood to meet them. I knew what to do. I swung the flat of my sword against the first guy's head and knocked his helmet clean off. I hit him so hard I could see his eyes vibrating as he crumpled into the water.  Ugly Number Two and Ugly Number Three came at me. I slammed one in the face with my shield and used my sword to shear off the other guy's horsehair plume. Both of them backed up quick. Ugly Number Four didn't look really anxious to attack, but Clarisse kept coming, the point of her spear crackling with energy. As soon as she thrust, I caught the shaft between the edge of my shield and my sword, and I snapped it like a twig.  ""Ah!"" she screamed. ""You idiot! You corpse-breath worm!""  She probably would've said worse, but I smacked her between the eyes with my sword-butt and sent her stumbling backward out of the creek.  Then I heard yelling, elated screams, and I saw Luke racing toward the boundary line with the red team's banner lifted high. He was flanked by a couple of Hermes guys covering his retreat, and a few Apollos behind them, fighting off the Hephaestus kids. The Ares folks got up, and Clarisse muttered a dazed curse.  ""A trick!"" she shouted. ""It was a trick.""  They staggered after Luke, but it was too late. Everybody converged on the creek as Luke ran across into friendly territory. Our side exploded into cheers. The red banner shimmered and turned to silver. The boar and spear were replaced with a huge caduceus, the symbol of cabin eleven. Everybody on the blue team picked up Luke and started carrying him around on their shoulders. Chiron cantered out from the woods and blew the conch horn.  The game was over. We'd won.  I was about to join the celebration when Annabeth's voice, right next to me in the creek, said, ""Not bad, hero.""  I looked, but she wasn't there.  ""Where the heck did you learn to fight like that?"" she asked. The air shimmered, and she materialized, holding a Yankees baseball cap as if she'd just taken it off her head.  I felt myself getting angry. I wasn't even fazed by the fact that she'd just been invisible. ""You set me up,"" I said. ""You put me here because you knew Clarisse would come after me, while you sent Luke around the flank. You had it all figured out.""  Annabeth shrugged. ""I told you. Athena always, always has a plan.""  ""A plan to get me pulverized.""  ""I came as fast as I could. I was about to jump in, but ..."" She shrugged. ""You didn't need help.""  Then she noticed my wounded arm. ""How did you do that?""  ""Sword cut,"" I said. ""What do you think?""  ""No. It was a sword cut. Look at it.""  The blood was gone. Where the huge cut had been, there was a long white scratch, and even that was fading. As I watched, it turned into a small scar, and disappeared.  ""I—I don't get it,"" I said.  Annabeth was thinking hard. I could almost see the gears turning. She looked down at my feet, then at Clarisse's broken spear, and said, ""Step out of the water, Percy.""  ""What—""  ""Just do it.""  I came out of the creek and immediately felt bone tired. My arms started to go numb again. My adrenaline rush left me. I almost fell over, but Annabeth steadied me.  ""Oh, Styx,"" she cursed. ""This is not good. I didn't want ... I assumed it would be Zeus... .""  Before I could ask what she meant, I heard that canine growl again, but much closer than before. A howl ripped through the forest.  The campers' cheering died instantly. Chiron shouted something in Ancient Greek, which I would realize, only later, I had understood perfectly: ""Stand ready! My bow!""  Annabeth drew her sword.  There on the rocks just above us was a black hound the size of a rhino, with lava-red eyes and fangs like daggers.  It was looking straight at me.  Nobody moved except Annabeth, who yelled, ""Percy, run!""  She tried to step in front of me, but the hound was too fast. It leaped over her—an enormous shadow with teeth—and just as it hit me, as I stumbled backward and felt its razor-sharp claws ripping through my armor, there was a cascade of thwacking sounds, like forty pieces of paper being ripped one after the other. From the hounds neck sprouted a cluster of arrows. The monster fell dead at my feet.  By some miracle, I was still alive. I didn't want to look underneath the ruins of my shredded armor. My chest felt warm and wet, and I knew I was badly cut. Another second, and the monster would've turned me into a hundred pounds of delicatessen meat.  Chiron trotted up next to us, a bow in his hand, his face grim.  ""Di immortales!"" Annabeth said. ""That's a hellhound from the Fields of Punishment. They don't ... they're not supposed to ...""  ""Someone summoned it,"" Chiron said. ""Someone inside the camp.""  Luke came over, the banner in his hand forgotten, his moment of glory gone.  Clarisse yelled, ""It's all Percy's fault! Percy summoned it!""  ""Be quiet, child,"" Chiron told her.  We watched the body of the hellhound melt into shadow, soaking into the ground until it disappeared.  ""You're wounded,"" Annabeth told me. ""Quick, Percy, get in the water.""  ""I'm okay.""  ""No, you're not,"" she said. ""Chiron, watch this.""  I was too tired to argue. I stepped back into the creek, the whole camp gathering around me.  Instantly, I felt better. I could feel the cuts on my chest closing up. Some of the campers gasped.  ""Look, I—I don't know why,"" I said, trying to apologize. ""I'm sorry....""  But they weren't watching my wounds heal. They were staring at something above my head.  ""Percy,"" Annabeth said, pointing. ""Um ...""  By the time I looked up, the sign was already fading, but I could still make out the hologram of green light, spinning and gleaming. A three-tipped spear: a trident.  ""Your father,"" Annabeth murmured. ""This is really not good.""  ""It is determined,"" Chiron announced.  All around me, campers started kneeling, even the Ares cabin, though they didn't look happy about it.  ""My father?"" I asked, completely bewildered.  ""Poseidon,"" said Chiron. ""Earthshaker, Stormbringer, Father of Horses. Hail, Perseus Jackson, Son of the Sea God."""
Percy Jackson 1 Chapter 9,"The next morning, Chiron moved me to cabin three.  I didn't have to share with anybody. I had plenty of room for all my stuff: the Minotaur's horn, one set of spare clothes, and a toiletry bag. I got to sit at my own dinner table, pick all my own activities, call ""lights out"" whenever I felt like it, and not listen to anybody else.  And I was absolutely miserable.  Just when I'd started to feel accepted, to feel I had a home in cabin eleven and I might be a normal kid—or as normal as you can be when you're a half-blood—I'd been separated out as if I had some rare disease.  Nobody mentioned the hellhound, but I got the feeling they were all talking about it behind my back. The attack had scared everybody. It sent two messages: one, that I was the son of the Sea God; and two, monsters would stop at nothing to kill me. They could even invade a camp that had always been considered safe.  The other campers steered clear of me as much as possible. Cabin eleven was too nervous to have sword class with me after what I'd done to the Ares folks in the woods, so my lessons with Luke became one-on-one. He pushed me harder than ever, and wasn't afraid to bruise me up in the process.  ""You're going to need all the training you can get,"" he promised, as we were working with swords and flaming torches. ""Now let's try that viper-beheading strike again. Fifty more repetitions.""  Annabeth still taught me Greek in the mornings, but she seemed distracted. Every time I said something, she scowled at me, as if I'd just poked her between the eyes.  After lessons, she would walk away muttering to herself: ""Quest ... Poseidon? ... Dirty rotten ... Got to make a plan ...""  Even Clarisse kept her distance, though her venomous looks made it clear she wanted to kill me for breaking her magic spear. I wished she would just yell or punch me or something. I'd rather get into fights every day than be ignored.  I knew somebody at camp resented me, because one night I came into my cabin and found a mortal newspaper dropped inside the doorway, a copy of the New York Daily News, opened to the Metro page. The article took me almost an hour to read, because the angrier I got, the more the words floated around on the page.  BOY AND MOTHER STILL MISSING AFTER  FREAK CAR ACCIDENT  BY EILEEN SMYTHE  Sally Jackson and son Percy are still missing one week after their mysterious disappearance. The family's badly burned '78 Camaro was discovered last Saturday on a north Long Island road with the roof ripped off and the front axle broken. The car had flipped and skidded for several hundred feet before exploding. Mother and son had gone for a weekend vacation to Montauk, but left hastily, under mysterious circumstances. Small traces of blood were found in the car and near the scene of the wreck, but there were no other signs of the missing Jacksons. Residents in the rural area reported seeing nothing unusual around the time of the accident.  Ms. Jackson's husband, Gabe Ugliano, claims that his stepson, Percy Jackson, is a troubled child who has been kicked out of numerous boarding schools and has expressed violent tendencies in the past.  Police would not say whether son Percy is a suspect in his mother's disappearance, but they have not ruled out foul play. Below are recent pictures of Sally Jackson and Percy. Police urge anyone with information to call the following toll-free crime-stoppers hotline.  The phone number was circled in black marker.  I wadded up the paper and threw it away, then flopped down in my bunk bed in the middle of my empty cabin.  ""Lights out,"" I told myself miserably.  That night, I had my worst dream yet.  I was running along the beach in a storm. This time, there was a city behind me. Not New York. The sprawl was different: buildings spread farther apart, palm trees and low hills in the distance.  About a hundred yards down the surf, two men were fighting. They looked like TV wrestlers, muscular, with beards and long hair. Both wore flowing Greek tunics, one trimmed in blue, the other in green. They grappled with each other, wrestled, kicked and head-butted, and every time they connected, lightning flashed, the sky grew darker, and the wind rose.  I had to stop them. I didn't know why. But the harder I ran, the more the wind blew me back, until I was running in place, my heels digging uselessly in the sand.  Over the roar of the storm, I could hear the blue-robed one yelling at the green-robed one, Give it back! Give it back! Like a kindergartner fighting over a toy.  The waves got bigger, crashing into the beach, spraying me with salt.  I yelled, Stop it! Stop fighting!  The ground shook. Laughter came from somewhere under the earth, and a voice so deep and evil it turned my blood to ice.  Come down, little hero, the voice crooned. Come down!  The sand split beneath me, opening up a crevice straight down to the center of the earth. My feet slipped, and darkness swallowed me.  I woke up, sure I was falling.  I was still in bed in cabin three. My body told me it was morning, but it was dark outside, and thunder rolled across the hills. A storm was brewing. I hadn't dreamed that.  I heard a clopping sound at the door, a hoof knocking on the threshold.  ""Come in?""  Grover trotted inside, looking worried. ""Mr. D wants to see you.""  ""Why?""  ""He wants to kill... I mean, I'd better let him tell you.""  Nervously, I got dressed and followed, sure that I was in huge trouble.  For days, I'd been half expecting a summons to the Big House. Now that I was declared a son of Poseidon, one of the Big Three gods who weren't supposed to have kids, I figured it was a crime for me just to be alive. The other gods had probably been debating the best way to punish me for existing, and now Mr. D was ready to deliver their verdict.  Over Long Island Sound, the sky looked like ink soup coming to a boil. A hazy curtain of rain was coming in our direction. I asked Grover if we needed an umbrella.  ""No,"" he said. ""It never rains here unless we want it to.""  I pointed at the storm. ""What the heck is that, then?""  He glanced uneasily at the sky. ""It'll pass around us. Bad weather always does.""  I realized he was right. In the week I'd been here, it had never even been overcast. The few rain clouds I'd seen had skirted right around the edges of the valley.  But this storm ... this one was huge.  At the volleyball pit, the kids from Apollo's cabin were playing a morning game against the satyrs. Dionysus's twins were walking around in the strawberry fields, making the plants grow. Everybody was going about their normal business, but they looked tense. They kept their eyes on the storm.  Grover and I walked up to the front porch of the Big House. Dionysus sat at the pinochle table in his tiger-striped Hawaiian shirt with his Diet Coke, just as he had on my first day. Chiron sat across the table in his fake wheelchair. They were playing against invisible opponents--two sets of cards hovering in the air.  ""Well, well,"" Mr. D said without looking up. ""Our little celebrity.""  I waited.. . . . . . . . . ""Come closer,"" Mr. D said. ""And don't expect me to kowtow to you, mortal, just because old Barnacle-Beard is your father.""  A net of lightning flashed across the clouds. Thunder shook the windows of the house.  ""Blah, blah, blah,"" Dionysus said.  Chiron feigned interest in his pinochle cards. Grover cowered by the railing, his hooves clopping back and forth.  ""If I had my way,"" Dionysus said, ""I would cause your molecules to erupt in flames. We'd sweep up the ashes and be done with a lot of trouble. But Chiron seems to feel this would be against my mission at this cursed camp: to keep you little brats safe from harm.""  ""Spontaneous combustion is a form of harm, Mr. D,"" Chiron put in.  ""Nonsense,"" Dionysus said. ""Boy wouldn't feel a thing. Nevertheless, I've agreed to restrain myself I'm thinking of turning you into a dolphin instead, sending you back to your father.""  ""Mr. D—"" Chiron warned.  ""Oh, all right,"" Dionysus relented. ""There's one more option. But it's deadly foolishness."" Dionysus rose, and the invisible players' cards dropped to the table. ""I'm off to Olympus for the emergency meeting. If the boy is still here when I get back, I'll turn him into an Atlantic bottlenose. Do you understand? And Perseus Jackson, if you're at all smart, you'll see that's a much more sensible choice than what Chiron feels you must do.""  Dionysus picked up a playing card, twisted it, and it became a plastic rectangle. A credit card? No. A security pass.  He snapped his fingers.  The air seemed to fold and bend around him. He became a hologram, then a wind, then he was gone, leaving only the smell of fresh-pressed grapes lingering behind.  Chiron smiled at me, but he looked tired and strained. ""Sit, Percy, please. And Grover.""  We did.  Chiron laid his cards on the table, a winning hand he hadn't gotten to use.  ""Tell me, Percy,"" he said. ""What did you make of the hellhound?""  Just hearing the name made me shudder.  Chiron probably wanted me to say, Heck, it was nothing. I eat hellhounds for breakfast. But I didn't feel like lying.  ""It scared me,"" I said. ""If you hadn't shot it, I'd be dead.""  ""You'll meet worse, Percy. Far worse, before you're done.""  ""Done ... with what?""  ""Your quest, of course. Will you accept it?""  I glanced at Grover, who was crossing his fingers.  ""Um, sir,"" I said, ""you haven't told me what it is yet.""  Chiron grimaced. ""Well, that's the hard part, the details.""  Thunder rumbled across the valley. The storm clouds had now reached the edge of the beach. As far as I could see, the sky and the sea were boiling together.  ""Poseidon and Zeus,"" I said. ""They're fighting over something valuable ... something that was stolen, aren't they?"".  Chiron and Grover exchanged looks.  Chiron sat forward in his wheelchair. ""How did you know that?""  My face felt hot. I wished I hadn't opened my big mouth. ""The weather since Christmas has been weird, like the sea and the sky are fighting. Then I talked to Annabeth, and she'd overheard something about a theft. And ... I've also been having these dreams.""  ""I knew it,"" Grover said.  ""Hush, satyr,"" Chiron ordered.  ""But it is his quest!"" Grover's eyes were bright with excitement. ""It must be!""  ""Only the Oracle can determine."" Chiron stroked his bristly beard. ""Nevertheless, Percy, you are correct. Your father and Zeus are having their worst quarrel in centuries. They are fighting over something valuable that was stolen. To be precise: a lightning bolt.""  I laughed nervously. ""A what?""  ""Do not take this lightly,"" Chiron warned. ""I'm not talking about some tinfoil-covered zigzag you'd see in a second-grade play. I'm talking about a two-foot-long cylinder of high-grade celestial bronze, capped on both ends with god-level explosives.""  ""Oh.""  ""Zeus's master bolt,"" Chiron said, getting worked up now. ""The symbol of his power, from which all other lightning bolts are patterned. The first weapon made by the Cyclopes for the war against the Titans, the bolt that sheered the top off Mount Etna and hurled Kronos from his throne; the master bolt, which packs enough power to make mortal hydrogen bombs look like firecrackers.""  ""And it's missing?""  ""Stolen,"" Chiron said.  ""By who?""  ""By whom,"" Chiron corrected. Once a teacher, always a teacher. ""By you.""  My mouth fell open.  ""At least""—Chiron held up a hand—""that's what Zeus thinks. During the winter solstice, at the last council of the gods, Zeus and Poseidon had an argument. The usual nonsense: 'Mother Rhea always liked you best', 'Air disasters are more spectacular than sea disasters,' et cetera. Afterward, Zeus realized his master bolt was missing, taken from the throne room under his very nose. He immediately blamed Poseidon. Now, a god cannot usurp another god's symbol of power directly—that is forbidden by the most ancient of divine laws. But Zeus believes your father convinced a human hero to take it.""  ""But I didn't—""  ""Patience and listen, child,"" Chiron said. ""Zeus has good reason to be suspicious. The forges of the Cyclopes are under the ocean, which gives Poseidon some influence over the makers of his brother's lightning. Zeus believes Poseidon has taken the master bolt, and is now secretly having the Cyclopes build an arsenal of illegal copies, which might be used to topple Zeus from his throne. The only thing Zeus wasn't sure about was which hero Poseidon used to steal the bolt. Now Poseidon has openly claimed you as his son. You were in New York over the winter holidays. You could easily have snuck into Olympus. Zeus believes he has found his thief.""  ""But I've never even been to Olympus! Zeus is crazy!""  Chiron and Grover glanced nervously at the sky. The clouds didn't seem to be parting around us, as Grover had promised. They were rolling straight over our valley, sealing us in like a coffin lid.  ""Er, Percy ...?"" Grover said. ""We don't use the c-word to describe the Lord of the Sky.""  ""Perhaps paranoid,"" Chiron suggested. ""Then again, Poseidon has tried to unseat Zeus before. I believe that was question thirty-eight on your final exam...."" He looked at me as if he actually expected me to remember question thirty-eight.  How could anyone accuse me of stealing a god's weapon? I couldn't even steal a slice of pizza from Gabe's poker party without getting busted. Chiron was waiting for an answer.  ""Something about a golden net?"" I guessed. ""Poseidon and Hera and a few other gods ... they, like, trapped Zeus and wouldn't let him out until he promised to be a better ruler, right?""  ""Correct,"" Chiron said. ""And Zeus has never trusted Poseidon since. Of course, Poseidon denies stealing the master bolt. He took great offense at the accusation. The two have been arguing back and forth for months, threatening war. And now, you've come along—the proverbial last straw."" ""But I'm just a kid!""  ""Percy,"" Grover cut in, ""if you were Zeus, and you already thought your brother was plotting to overthrow you, then your brother suddenly admitted he had broken the sacred oath he took after World War II, that he's fathered a new mortal hero who might be used as a weapon against you.... Wouldn't that put a twist in your toga?""  ""But I didn't do anything. Poseidon—my dad—he didn't really have this master bolt stolen, did he?""  Chiron sighed. ""Most thinking observers would agree that thievery is not Poseidon's style. But the Sea God is too proud to try convincing Zeus of that. Zeus has demanded that Poseidon return the bolt by the summer solstice. That's June twenty-first, ten days from now. Poseidon wants an apology for being called a thief by the same date. I hoped that diplomacy might prevail, that Hera or Demeter or Hestia would make the two brothers see sense. But your arrival has inflamed Zeus's temper. Now neither god will back down. Unless someone intervenes, unless the master bolt is found and returned to Zeus before the solstice, there will be war. And do you know what a full-fledged war would look like, Percy?""  ""Bad?"" I guessed.  ""Imagine the world in chaos. Nature at war with itself. Olympians forced to choose sides between Zeus and Poseidon. Destruction. Carnage. Millions dead. Western civilization turned into a battleground so big it will make the Trojan War look like a water-balloon fight.""  ""Bad,"" I repeated.  ""And you, Percy Jackson, would be the first to feel Zeus's wrath.""  It started to rain. Volleyball players stopped their game and stared in stunned silence at the sky.  I had brought this storm to Half-Blood Hill. Zeus was punishing the whole camp because of me. I was furious.  ""So I have to find the stupid bolt,"" I said. ""And return it to Zeus.""  ""What better peace offering,"" Chiron said, ""than to have the son of Poseidon return Zeus's property?""  ""If Poseidon doesn't have it, where is the thing?""  ""I believe I know."" Chiron's expression was grim. ""Part of a prophecy I had years ago ... well, some of the lines make sense to me, now. But before I can say more, you must officially take up the quest. You must seek the counsel of the Oracle.""  ""Why can't you tell me where the bolt is beforehand?""  ""Because if I did, you would be too afraid to accept the challenge.""  I swallowed. ""Good reason.""  ""You agree then?""  I looked at Grover, who nodded encouragingly.  Easy for him. I was the one Zeus wanted to kill.  ""All right,"" I said. ""It's better than being turned into a dolphin.""  ""Then it's time you consulted the Oracle,"" Chiron said. ""Go upstairs, Percy Jackson, to the attic. When you come back down, assuming you're still sane, we will talk more.""  Four flights up, the stairs ended under a green trapdoor.  I pulled the cord. The door swung down, and a wooden ladder clattered into place.  The warm air from above smelled like mildew and rotten wood and something else ... a smell I remembered from biology class. Reptiles. The smell of snakes.  I held my breath and climbed.  The attic was filled with Greek hero junk: armor stands covered in cobwebs; once-bright shields pitted with rust; old leather steamer trunks plastered with stickers saying ITHAKA, CIRCE'S ISLE, and LAND OF THE AMAZONS. One long table was stacked with glass jars filled with pickled things—severed hairy claws, huge yellow eyes, various other parts of monsters. A dusty mounted trophy on the wall looked like a giant snake's head, but with horns and a full set of shark's teeth. The plaque read, HYDRA HEAD #1, WOODSTOCK, N.Y., 1969.  By the window, sitting on a wooden tripod stool, was the most gruesome memento of all: a mummy. Not the wrapped-in-cloth kind, but a human female body shriveled to a husk. She wore a tie-dyed sundress, lots of beaded necklaces, and a headband over long black hair. The skin of her face was thin and leathery over her skull, and her eyes were glassy white slits, as if the real eyes had been replaced by marbles; she'd been dead a long, long time.  Looking at her sent chills up my back. And that was before she sat up on her stool and opened her mouth. A green mist poured from the mummy's mouth, coiling over the floor in thick tendrils, hissing like twenty thousand snakes. I stumbled over myself trying to get to the trapdoor, but it slammed shut. Inside my head, I heard a voice, slithering into one ear and coiling around my brain: I am the spirit of Delphi, speaker of the prophecies of Phoebus Apollo, slayer of the mighty Python. Approach, seeker, and ask.  I wanted to say, No thanks, wrong door, just looking for the bathroom. But I forced myself to take a deep breath.  The mummy wasn't alive. She was some kind of gruesome receptacle for something else, the power that was now swirling around me in the green mist. But its presence didn't feel evil, like my demonic math teacher Mrs. Dodds or the Minotaur. It felt more like the Three Fates I'd seen knitting the yarn outside the highway fruit stand: ancient, powerful, and definitely not human. But not particularly interested in killing me, either.  I got up the courage to ask, ""What is my destiny?""  The mist swirled more thickly, collecting right in front of me and around the table with the pickled monster-part jars. Suddenly there were four men sitting around the table, playing cards. Their faces became clearer. It was Smelly Gabe and his buddies.  My fists clenched, though I knew this poker party couldn't be real. It was an illusion, made out of mist.  Gabe turned toward me and spoke in the rasping voice of the Oracle: You shall go west, and face the god who has turned.  His buddy on the right looked up and said in the same voice: You shall find what was stolen, and see it safely returned.  The guy on the left threw in two poker chips, then said: You shall be betrayed by one who calls you a friend.  Finally, Eddie, our building super, delivered the worst line of all: And you shall fail to save what matters most, in the end.  The figures began to dissolve. At first I was too stunned to say anything, but as the mist retreated, coiling into a huge green serpent and slithering back into the mouth of the mummy, I cried, ""Wait! What do you mean? What friend? What will I fail to save?""  The tail of the mist snake disappeared into the mummy's mouth. She reclined back against the wall. Her mouth closed tight, as if it hadn't been open in a hundred years. The attic was silent again, abandoned, nothing but a room full of mementos.  I got the feeling that I could stand here until I had cobwebs, too, and I wouldn't learn anything else.  My audience with the Oracle was over.  ""Well?"" Chiron asked me.  I slumped into a chair at the pinochle table. ""She said I would retrieve what was stolen.""  Grover sat forward, chewing excitedly on the remains of a Diet Coke can. ""That's great!""  ""What did the Oracle say exactly?"" Chiron pressed. ""This is important.""  My ears were still tingling from the reptilian voice. ""She . .. she said I would go west and face a god who had turned. I would retrieve what was stolen and see it safely returned.""  ""I knew it,"" Grover said.. . .. Chiron didn't look satisfied. ""Anything else?""  I didn't want to tell him.  What friend would betray me? I didn't have that many.  And the last line—I would fail to save what mattered most. What kind of Oracle would send me on a quest and tell me, Oh, by the way, you'll fail  How could I confess that?  ""No,"" I said. ""That's about it.""  He studied my face. ""Very well, Percy. But know this: the Oracle's words often have double meanings. Don't dwell on them too much. The truth is not always clear until events come to pass.""  I got the feeling he knew I was holding back something bad, and he was trying to make me feel better.  ""Okay,"" I said, anxious to change topics. ""So where do I go? Who's this god in the west?""  ""Ah, think, Percy,"" Chiron said. ""If Zeus and Poseidon weaken each other in a war, who stands to gain?""  ""Somebody else who wants to take over?"" I guessed.  ""Yes, quite. Someone who harbors a grudge, who has been unhappy with his lot since the world was divided eons ago, whose kingdom would grow powerful with the deaths of millions. Someone who hates his brothers for forcing him into an oath to have no more children, an oath that both of them have now broken.""  I thought about my dreams, the evil voice that had spoken from under the ground. ""Hades.""  Chiron nodded. ""The Lord of the Dead is the only possibility.""  A scrap of aluminum dribbled out of Grover's mouth. ""Whoa, wait. Wh-what?""  ""A Fury came after Percy,"" Chiron reminded him. ""She watched the young man until she was sure of his identity, then tried to kill him. Furies obey only one lord: Hades.""  ""Yes, but—but Hades hates all heroes,"" Grover protested. ""Especially if he has found out Percy is a son of Poseidon... .""  ""A hellhound got into the forest,"" Chiron continued. ""Those can only be summoned from the Fields of Punishment, and it had to be summoned by someone within the camp. Hades must have a spy here. He must suspect Poseidon will try to use Percy to clear his name. Hades would very much like to kill this young half-blood before he can take on the quest.""  ""Great,"" I muttered. ""That's two major gods who want to kill me.""  ""But a quest to ..."" Grover swallowed. ""I mean, couldn't the master bolt be in some place like Maine? Maine's very nice this time of year.""  ""Hades sent a minion to steal the master bolt,"" Chiron insisted. ""He hid it in the Underworld, knowing full well that Zeus would blame Poseidon. I don't pretend to understand the Lord of the Dead's motives perfectly, or why he chose this time to start a war, but one thing is certain. Percy must go to the Underworld, find the master bolt, and reveal the truth.""  A strange fire burned in my stomach. The weirdest thing was: it wasn't fear. It was anticipation. The desire for revenge. Hades had tried to kill me three times so far, with the Fury, the Minotaur, and the hellhound. It was his fault my mother had disappeared in a flash of light. Now he was trying to frame me and my dad for a theft we hadn't committed.  I was ready to take him on.  Besides, if my mother was in the Underworld ...  Whoa, boy, said the small part of my brain that was still sane. You're a kid. Hades is a god.  Grover was trembling. He'd started eating pinochle cards like potato chips.  The poor guy needed to complete a quest with me so he could get his searcher's license, whatever that was, but how could I ask him to do this quest, especially when the Oracle said I was destined to fail? This was suicide.  ""Look, if we know it's Hades,"" I told Chiron, ""why can't we just tell the other gods? Zeus or Poseidon could go down to the Underworld and bust some heads.""  ""Suspecting and knowing are not the same,"" Chiron said. ""Besides, even if the other gods suspect Hades—and I imagine Poseidon does—they couldn't retrieve the bolt themselves. Gods cannot cross each other's territories except by invitation. That is another ancient rule. Heroes, on the other hand, have certain privileges. They can go anywhere, challenge anyone, as long as they're bold enough and strong enough to do it. No god can be held responsible for a hero's actions. Why do you think the gods always operate through humans?"" ""You're saying I'm being used.""  ""I'm saying it's no accident Poseidon has claimed you now. It's a very risky gamble, but he's in a desperate situation. He needs you.""  My dad needs me.  Emotions rolled around inside me like bits of glass in a kaleidoscope. I didn't know whether to feel resentful or grateful or happy or angry. Poseidon had ignored me for twelve years. Now suddenly he needed me.  I looked at Chiron. ""You've known I was Poseidon's son all along, haven't you?""  ""I had my suspicions. As I said ... I've spoken to the Oracle, too.""  I got the feeling there was a lot he wasn't telling me about his prophecy, but I decided I couldn't worry about that right now. After all, I was holding back information too.  ""So let me get this straight,"" I said. ""I'm supposed go to the Underworld and confront the Lord of the Dead.""  ""Check,"" Chiron said.  ""Find the most powerful weapon in the universe.""  ""Check.""  ""And get it back to Olympus before the summer solstice, in ten days.""  ""That's about right.""  I looked at Grover, who gulped down the ace of hearts.  ""Did I mention that Maine is very nice this time of year?"" he asked weakly.  ""You don't have to go,"" I told him. ""I can't ask that of you.   ""Oh ..."" He shifted his hooves. ""No ... it's just that satyrs and underground places ... well...""   He took a deep breath, then stood, brushing the shredded cards and aluminum bits off his T-shirt. ""You saved my life, Percy. If ... if you're serious about wanting me along, I won't let you down.""  I felt so relieved I wanted to cry, though I didn't think that would be very heroic. Grover was the only friend I'd ever had for longer than a few months. I wasn't sure what good a satyr could do against the forces of the dead, but I felt better knowing he'd be with me.  ""All the way, G-man."" I turned to Chiron. ""So where do we go? The Oracle just said to go west.""  ""The entrance to the Underworld is always in the west. It moves from age to age, just like Olympus. Right now, of course, it's in America.""  ""Where?""  Chiron looked surprised. ""I thought that would be obvious enough. The entrance to the Underworld is in Los Angeles.""  ""Oh,"" I said. ""Naturally. So we just get on a plane—""  ""No!"" Grover shrieked. ""Percy, what are you thinking? Have you ever been on a plane in your life?""  I shook my head, feeling embarrassed. My mom had never taken me anywhere by plane. She'd always said we didn't have the money. Besides, her parents had died in a plane crash.  ""Percy, think,"" Chiron said. ""You are the son of the Sea God. Your father's bitterest rival is Zeus, Lord of the Sky. Your mother knew better than to trust you in an airplane. You would be in Zeus's domain. You would never come down again alive.""  Overhead, lightning crackled. Thunder boomed.  ""Okay,"" I said, determined not to look at the storm. ""So, I'll travel overland.""  ""That's right,"" Chiron said. ""Two companions may accompany you. Grover is one. The other has already volunteered, if you will accept her help.""  ""Gee,"" I said, feigning surprise. ""Who else would be stupid enough to volunteer for a quest like this?""  The air shimmered behind Chiron.  Annabeth became visible, stuffing her Yankees cap into her back pocket.  ""I've been waiting a long time for a quest, seaweed brain,"" she said. ""Athena is no fan of Poseidon, but if you're going to save the world, I'm the best person to keep you from messing up.""  ""If you do say so yourself,"" I said. ""I suppose you have a plan, wise girl?""  Her cheeks colored. ""Do you want my help or not?""  The truth was, I did. I needed all the help I could get.  ""A trio,"" I said. ""That'll work.""  ""Excellent,"" Chiron said. ""This afternoon, we can take you as far as the bus terminal in Manhattan. After that, you are on your own.""  Lightning flashed. Rain poured down on the meadows that were never supposed to have violent weather.  ""No time to waste,"" Chiron said. ""I think you should all get packing."""
Percy Jackson 1 Chapter 10,"It didn't take me long to pack. I decided to leave the Minotaur horn in my cabin, which left me only an extra change of clothes and a toothbrush to stuff in a backpack Grover had found for me.  The camp store loaned me one hundred dollars in mortal money and twenty golden drachmas. These coins were as big as Girl Scout cookies and had images of various Greek gods stamped on one side and the EmpireStateBuilding on the other. The ancient mortal drachmas had been silver, Chiron told us, but Olympians never used less than pure gold. Chiron said the coins might come in handy for non-mortal transactions—whatever that meant. He gave Annabeth and me each a canteen of nectar and a Ziploc bag full of ambrosia squares, to be used only in emergencies, if we were seriously hurt. It was god food, Chiron reminded us. It would cure us of almost any injury, but it was lethal to mortals. Too much of it would make a half-blood very, very feverish. An overdose would burn us up, literally.  Annabeth was bringing her magic Yankees cap, which she told me had been a twelfth-birthday present from her mom. She carried a book on famous classical architecture, written in Ancient Greek, to read when she got bored, and a long bronze knife, hidden in her shirt sleeve. I was sure the knife would get us busted the first time we went through a metal detector.  Grover wore his fake feet and his pants to pass as human. He wore a green rasta-style cap, because when it rained his curly hair flattened and you could just see the tips of his horns. His bright orange backpack was full of scrap metal and apples to snack on. In his pocket was a set of reed pipes his daddy goat had carved for him, even though he only knew two songs: Mozart's Piano Concerto no. 12 and Hilary Duff's ""So Yesterday,"" both of which sounded pretty bad on reed pipes.  We waved good-bye to the other campers, took one last look at the strawberry fields, the ocean, and the Big House, then hiked up Half-Blood Hill to the tall pine tree that used to be Thalia, daughter of Zeus.  Chiron was waiting for us in his wheelchair. Next to him stood the surfer dude I'd seen when I was recovering in the sick room. According to Grover, the guy was the camp's head of security. He supposedly had eyes all over his body so he could never be surprised. Today, though, he was wearing a chauffeur's uniform, so I could only see extra peepers on his hands, face and neck.  ""This is Argus,"" Chiron told me. ""He will drive you into the city, and, er, well, keep an eye on things.""  I heard footsteps behind us.  Luke came running up the hill, carrying a pair of basketball shoes.  ""Hey!"" he panted. ""Glad I caught you.""  Annabeth blushed, the way she always did when Luke was around.  ""Just wanted to say good luck,"" Luke told me. ""And I thought ... um, maybe you could use these.""  He handed me the sneakers, which looked pretty normal. They even smelled kind of normal.  Luke said, ""Maia!""  White bird's wings sprouted out of the heels, startling me so much, I dropped them. The shoes flapped around on the ground until the wings folded up and disappeared.  ""Awesome!"" Grover said.  Luke smiled. ""Those served me well when I was on my quest. Gift from Dad. Of course, I don't use them much these days...."" His expression turned sad.  I didn't know what to say. It was cool enough that Luke had come to say good-bye. I'd been afraid he might resent me for getting so much attention the last few days. But here he was giving me a magic gift.... It made me blush almost as much as Annabeth.  ""Hey, man,"" I said. ""Thanks.""  ""Listen, Percy ..."" Luke looked uncomfortable. ""A lot of hopes are riding on you. So just ... kill some monsters for me, okay?""  We shook hands. Luke patted Grover's head between his horns, then gave a good-bye hug to Annabeth, who looked like she might pass out.  After Luke was gone, I told her, ""You're hyperventilating.""  ""Am not.""  ""You let him capture the flag instead of you, didn't you?""  ""Oh ... why do I want to go anywhere with you, Percy?""  She stomped down the other side of the hill, where a white SUV waited on the shoulder of the road. Argus followed, jingling his car keys.  I picked up the flying shoes and had a sudden bad feeling. I looked at Chiron. ""I won't be able to use these, will I?""  He shook his head. ""Luke meant well, Percy. But taking to the air ... that would not be wise for you.""  I nodded, disappointed, but then I got an idea. ""Hey, Grover. You want a magic item?""  His eyes lit up. ""Me?""  Pretty soon we'd laced the sneakers over his fake feet, and the world's first flying goat boy was ready for launch.  ""Maia!"" he shouted.  He got off the ground okay, but then fell over sideways so his backpack dragged through the grass. The winged shoes kept bucking up and down like tiny broncos.  ""Practice,"" Chiron called after him. ""You just need practice!""  ""Aaaaa!"" Grover went flying sideways down the hill like a possessed lawn mower, heading toward the van.  Before I could follow, Chiron caught my arm. ""I should have trained you better, Percy,"" he said. ""If only I had more time. Hercules, Jason—they all got more training.""  ""That's okay. I just wish—""  I stopped myself because I was about to sound like a brat. I was wishing my dad had given me a cool magic item to help on the quest, something as good as Luke's flying shoes, or Annabeth's invisible cap.  ""What am I thinking?"" Chiron cried. ""I can't let you get away without this.""  He pulled a pen from his coat pocket and handed it to me. It was an ordinary disposable ballpoint, black ink, removable cap. Probably cost thirty cents.  ""Gee,"" I said. ""Thanks.""  ""Percy, that's a gift from your father. I've kept it for years, not knowing you were who I was waiting for. But the prophecy is clear to me now. You are the one.""  I remembered the field trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, when I'd vaporized Mrs. Dodds. Chiron had thrown me a pen that turned into a sword. Could this be ... ?  I took off the cap, and the pen grew longer and heavier in my hand. In half a second, I held a shimmering bronze sword with a double-edged blade, a leather-wrapped grip, and a flat hilt riveted with gold studs. It was the first weapon that actually felt balanced in my hand.  ""The sword has a long and tragic history that we need not go into,"" Chiron told me. ""Its name is Anaklusmos.""  ""'Riptide,'"" I translated, surprised the Ancient Greek came so easily.  ""Use it only for emergencies,"" Chiron said, ""and only against monsters. No hero should harm mortals unless absolutely necessary, of course, but this sword wouldn't harm them in any case.""  I looked at the wickedly sharp blade. ""What do you mean it wouldn't harm mortals? How could it not?""  ""The sword is celestial bronze. Forged by the Cyclopes, tempered in the heart of Mount Etna, cooled in the River Lethe. It's deadly to monsters, to any creature from the Underworld, provided they don't kill you first. But the blade will pass through mortals like an illusion. They simply are not important enough for the blade to kill. And I should warn you: as a demigod, you can be killed by either celestial or normal weapons. You are twice as vulnerable.""  ""Good to know.""  ""Now recap the pen.""  I touched the pen cap to the sword tip and instantly Riptide shrank to a ballpoint pen again. I tucked it in my pocket, a little nervous, because I was famous for losing pens at school.  ""You can't,"" Chiron said.  ""Can't what?""  ""Lose the pen,"" he said. ""It is enchanted. It will always reappear in your pocket. Try it.""  I was wary, but I threw the pen as far as I could down the hill and watched it disappear in the grass.  ""It may take a few moments,"" Chiron told me. ""Now check your pocket.""  Sure enough, the pen was there.  ""Okay, that's extremely cool,"" I admitted. ""But what if a mortal sees me pulling out a sword?""  Chiron smiled. ""Mist is a powerful thing, Percy.""  ""Mist?""  ""Yes. Read The Iliad. It's full of references to the stuff. Whenever divine or monstrous elements mix with the mortal world, they generate Mist, which obscures the vision of humans. You will see things just as they are, being a half-blood, but humans will interpret things quite differently. Remarkable, really, the lengths to which humans will go to fit things into their version of reality.""  I put Riptide back in my pocket.  For the first time, the quest felt real. I was actually leaving Half-Blood Hill. I was heading west with no adult supervision, no backup plan, not even a cell phone. (Chiron said cell phones were traceable by monsters; if we used one, it would be worse than sending up a flare.) I had no weapon stronger than a sword to fight off monsters and reach the Land of the Dead.  ""Chiron ..."" I said. ""When you say the gods are immortal... I mean, there was a time before them, right?""  ""Four ages before them, actually. The Time of the Titans was the Fourth Age, sometimes called the Golden Age, which is definitely a misnomer. This, the time of Western civilization and the rule of Zeus, is the Fifth Age.""  ""So what was it like ... before the gods?""  Chiron pursed his lips. ""Even I am not old enough to remember that, child, but I know it was a time of darkness and savagery for mortals. Kronos, the lord of the Titans, called his reign the Golden Age because men lived innocent and free of all knowledge. But that was mere propaganda. The Titan king cared nothing for your kind except as appetizers or a source of cheap entertainment. It was only in the early reign of Lord Zeus, when Prometheus the good Titan brought fire to mankind, that your species began to progress, and even then Prometheus was branded a radical thinker. Zeus punished him severely, as you may recall. Of course, eventually the gods warmed to humans, and Western civilization was born.""  ""But the gods can't die now, right? I mean, as long as Western civilization is alive, they're alive. So ... even if I failed, nothing could happen so bad it would mess up everything, right?""  Chiron gave me a melancholy smile. ""No one knows how long the Age of the West will last, Percy. The gods are immortal, yes. But then, so were the Titans. They still exist, locked away in their various prisons, forced to endure endless pain and punishment, reduced in power, but still very much alive. May the Fates forbid that the gods should ever suffer such a doom, or that we should ever return to the darkness and chaos of the past. All we can do, child, is follow our destiny.""  ""Our destiny ... assuming we know what that is.""  ""Relax,"" Chiron told me. ""Keep a clear head. And remember, you may be about to prevent the biggest war in human history.""  ""Relax,"" I said. ""I'm very relaxed.""  When I got to the bottom of the hill, I looked back. Under the pine tree that used to be Thalia, daughter of Zeus, Chiron was now standing in full horse-man form, holding his bow high in salute. Just your typical summer-camp send-off by your typical centaur.  * * *  Argus drove us out of the countryside and into western Long Island. It felt weird to be on a highway again, Annabeth and Grover sitting next to me as if we were normal carpoolers. After two weeks at Half-Blood Hill, the real world seemed like a fantasy. I found myself staring at every McDonald's, every kid in the back of his parents' car, every billboard and shopping mall.  ""So far so good,"" I told Annabeth. ""Ten miles and not a single monster.""  She gave me an irritated look. ""It's bad luck to talk that way, seaweed brain.""  ""Remind me again—why do you hate me so much?""  ""I don't hate you.""  ""Could've fooled me.""  She folded her cap of invisibility. ""Look ... we're just not supposed to get along, okay? Our parents are rivals.""  ""Why?""  She sighed. ""How many reasons do you want? One time my mom caught Poseidon with his girlfriend in Athena's temple, which is hugely disrespectful. Another time, Athena and Poseidon competed to be the patron god for the city of Athens. Your dad created some stupid saltwater spring for his gift. My mom created the olive tree. The people saw that her gift was better, so they named the city after her.""  ""They must really like olives.""  ""Oh, forget it.""  ""Now, if she'd invented pizza—that I could understand.""  ""I said, forget it!""  In the front seat, Argus smiled. He didn't say anything, but one blue eye on the back of his neck winked at me.  Traffic slowed us down in Queens. By the time we got into Manhattan it was sunset and starting to rain.  Argus dropped us at the Greyhound Station on the Upper East Side, not far from my mom and Gabe's apartment. Taped to a mailbox was a soggy flyer with my picture on it: HAVE YOU SEEN THIS BOY?  I ripped it down before Annabeth and Grover could notice.  Argus unloaded our bags, made sure we got our bus tickets, then drove away, the eye on the back of his hand opening to watch us as he pulled out of the parking lot.  I thought about how close I was to my old apartment. On a normal day, my mom would be home from the candy store by now. Smelly Gabe was probably up there right now, playing poker, not even missing her.  Grover shouldered his backpack. He gazed down the street in the direction I was looking. ""You want to know why she married him, Percy?""  I stared at him. ""Were you reading my mind or something?""  ""Just your emotions."" He shrugged. ""Guess I forgot to tell you satyrs can do that. You were thinking about your mom and your stepdad, right?""  I nodded, wondering what else Grover might've forgotten to tell me.  ""Your mom married Gabe for you,"" Grover told me. ""You call him 'Smelly,' but you've got no idea. The guy has this aura…. Yuck. I can smell him from here. I can smell traces of him on you, and you haven't been near him for a week.""  ""Thanks,"" I said. ""Where's the nearest shower?""  ""You should be grateful, Percy. Your stepfather smells so repulsively human he could mask the presence of any demigod. As soon as I took a whiff inside his Camaro, I knew: Gabe has been covering your scent for years. If you hadn't lived with him every summer, you probably would've been found by monsters a long time ago. Your mom stayed with him to protect you. She was a smart lady. She must've loved you a lot to put up with that guy—if that makes you feel any better.""  It didn't, but I forced myself not to show it. I'll see her again, I thought. She isn't gone.  I wondered if Grover could still read my emotions, mixed up as they were. I was glad he and Annabeth were with me, but I felt guilty that I hadn't been straight with them. I hadn't told them the real reason I'd said yes to this crazy quest.  The truth was, I didn't care about retrieving Zeus's lightning bolt, or saving the world, or even helping my father out of trouble. The more I thought about it, I resented Poseidon for never visiting me, never helping my mom, never even sending a lousy child-support check. He'd only claimed me because he needed a job done.  All I cared about was my mom. Hades had taken her unfairly, and Hades was going to give her back.  You will be betrayed by one who calls you a friend, the Oracle whispered in my mind. You will fail to save what matters most in the end.  Shut up, I told it.  The rain kept coming down.  We got restless waiting for the bus and decided to play some Hacky Sack with one of Grover's apples. Annabeth was unbelievable. She could bounce the apple off her knee, her elbow, her shoulder, whatever. I wasn't too bad myself.  The game ended when I tossed the apple toward Grover and it got too close to his mouth. In one mega goat bite, our Hacky Sack disappeared—core, stem, and all.  Grover blushed. He tried to apologize, but Annabeth and I were too busy cracking up.  Finally the bus came. As we stood in line to board, Grover started looking around, sniffing the air like he smelled his favorite school cafeteria delicacy—enchiladas.  ""What is it?"" I asked.  ""I don't know,"" he said tensely. ""Maybe it's nothing.""  But I could tell it wasn't nothing. I started looking over my shoulder, too.  I was relieved when we finally got on board and found seats together in the back of the bus. We stowed our backpacks. Annabeth kept slapping her Yankees cap nervously against her thigh.  As the last passengers got on, Annabeth clamped her hand onto my knee. ""Percy.""  An old lady had just boarded the bus. She wore a crumpled velvet dress, lace gloves, and a shapeless orange-knit hat that shadowed her face, and she carried a big paisley purse. When she tilted her head up, her black eyes glittered, and my heart skipped a beat.  It was Mrs. Dodds. Older, more withered, but definitely the same evil face.  I scrunched down in my seat.  Behind her came two more old ladies: one in a green hat, one in a purple hat. Otherwise they looked exactly like Mrs. Dodds—same gnarled hands, paisley handbags, wrinkled velvet dresses. Triplet demon grandmothers.  They sat in the front row, right behind the driver. The two on the aisle crossed their legs over the walkway, making an X. It was casual enough, but it sent a clear message: nobody leaves.  The bus pulled out of the station, and we headed through the slick streets of Manhattan. ""She didn't stay dead long,"" I said, trying to keep my voice from quivering. ""I thought you said they could be dispelled for a lifetime.""  ""I said if you're lucky,"" Annabeth said. ""You're obviously not.""  ""All three of them,"" Grover whimpered. ""Di immortales!""  ""It's okay,"" Annabeth said, obviously thinking hard. ""The Furies. The three worst monsters from the Underworld. No problem. No problem. We'll just slip out the windows.""  ""They don't open,"" Grover moaned.  ""A back exit?"" she suggested.  There wasn't one. Even if there had been, it wouldn't have helped. By that time, we were on Ninth Avenue, heading for the Lincoln Tunnel.  ""They won't attack us with witnesses around,"" I said. ""Will they?""  ""Mortals don't have good eyes,"" Annabeth reminded me. ""Their brains can only process what they see through the Mist.""  ""They'll see three old ladies killing us, won't they?""  She thought about it. ""Hard to say. But we can't count on mortals for help. Maybe an emergency exit in the roof ... ?""  We hit the Lincoln Tunnel, and the bus went dark except for the running lights down the aisle. It was eerily quiet without the sound of the rain. Mrs. Dodds got up. In a flat voice, as if she'd rehearsed it, she announced to the whole bus: ""I need to use the rest-room.""  ""So do I,"" said the second sister.  ""So do I,"" said the third sister.  They all started coming down the aisle.  ""I've got it,"" Annabeth said. ""Percy, take my hat.""  ""What?""  ""You're the one they want. Turn invisible and go up the aisle. Let them pass you. Maybe you can get to the front and get away.""  ""But you guys—""  ""There's an outside chance they might not notice us,"" Annabeth said. ""You're a son of one of the Big Three. Your smell might be overpowering.""  ""I can't just leave you.""  ""Don't worry about us,"" Grover said. ""Go!""  My hands trembled. I felt like a coward, but I took the Yankees cap and put it on.  When I looked down, my body wasn't there anymore.  I started creeping up the aisle. I managed to get up ten rows, then duck into an empty seat just as the Furies walked past.  Mrs. Dodds stopped, sniffing, and looked straight at me. My heart was pounding.  Apparently she didn't see anything. She and her sisters kept going.  I was free. I made it to the front of the bus. We were almost through the Lincoln Tunnel now. I was about to press the emergency stop button when I heard hideous wailing from the back row.  The old ladies were not old ladies anymore. Their faces were still the same—I guess those couldn't get any uglier— but their bodies had shriveled into leathery brown hag bodies with bat's wings and hands and feet like gargoyle claws. Their handbags had turned into fiery whips.  The Furies surrounded Grover and Annabeth, lashing their whips, hissing: ""Where is it? Where?""  The other people on the bus were screaming, cowering in their seats. They saw something, all right.  ""He's not here!"" Annabeth yelled. ""He's gone!""  The Furies raised their whips.  Annabeth drew her bronze knife. Grover grabbed a tin can from his snack bag and prepared to throw it.  What I did next was so impulsive and dangerous I should've been named ADHD poster child of the year.  The bus driver was distracted, trying to see what was going on in his rearview mirror.  Still invisible, I grabbed the wheel from him and jerked it to the left. Everybody howled as they were thrown to the right, and I heard what I hoped was the sound of three Furies smashing against the windows.  ""Hey!"" the driver yelled. ""Hey—whoa!""  We wrestled for the wheel. The bus slammed against the side of the tunnel, grinding metal, throwing sparks a mile behind us.  We careened out of the Lincoln Tunnel and back into the rainstorm, people and monsters tossed around the bus, cars plowed aside like bowling pins.  Somehow the driver found an exit. We shot off the highway, through half a dozen traffic lights, and ended up barreling down one of those New Jersey rural roads where you can't believe there's so much nothing right across the river from New York. There were woods to our left, the Hudson River to our right, and the driver seemed to be veering toward the river.  Another great idea: I hit the emergency brake.  The bus wailed, spun a full circle on the wet asphalt, and crashed into the trees. The emergency lights came on. The door flew open. The bus driver was the first one out, the passengers yelling as they stampeded after him. I stepped into the driver's seat and let them pass.  The Furies regained their balance. They lashed their whips at Annabeth while she waved her knife and yelled in Ancient Greek, telling them to back off. Grover threw tin cans.  I looked at the open doorway. I was free to go, but I couldn't leave my friends. I took off the invisible cap. ""Hey!""  The Furies turned, baring their yellow fangs at me, and the exit suddenly seemed like an excellent idea. Mrs. Dodds stalked up the aisle, just as she used to do in class, about to deliver my F- math test. Every time she flicked her whip, red flames danced along the barbed leather.  Her two ugly sisters hopped on top of the seats on either side of her and crawled toward me like huge nasty lizards.  ""Perseus Jackson,"" Mrs. Dodds said, in an accent that was definitely from somewhere farther south than Georgia. ""You have offended the gods. You shall die.""  ""I liked you better as a math teacher,"" I told her.  She growled.  Annabeth and Grover moved up behind the Furies cautiously, looking for an opening.  I took the ballpoint pen out of my pocket and uncapped it. Riptide elongated into a shimmering double-edged sword.  The Furies hesitated.  Mrs. Dodds had felt Riptide's blade before. She obviously didn't like seeing it again.  ""Submit now,"" she hissed. ""And you will not suffer eternal torment.""  ""Nice try,"" I told her.  ""Percy, look out!"" Annabeth cried.  Mrs. Dodds lashed her whip around my sword hand while the Furies on the either side lunged at me.  My hand felt like it was wrapped in molten lead, but I managed not to drop Riptide. I stuck the Fury on the left with its hilt, sending her toppling backward into a seat. I turned and sliced the Fury on the right. As soon as the blade connected with her neck, she screamed and exploded into dust. Annabeth got Mrs. Dodds in a wrestler's hold and yanked her backward while Grover ripped the whip out of her hands.  ""Ow!"" he yelled. ""Ow! Hot! Hot!""  The Fury I'd hilt-slammed came at me again, talons ready, but I swung Riptide and she broke open like a piñata.  Mrs. Dodds was trying to get Annabeth off her back. She kicked, clawed, hissed and bit, but Annabeth held on while Grover got Mrs. Dodds's legs tied up in her own whip. Finally they both shoved her backward into the aisle. Mrs. Dodds tried to get up, but she didn't have room to flap her bat wings, so she kept falling down.  ""Zeus will destroy you!"" she promised. ""Hades will have your soul!""  ""Braccas meas vescimini!"" I yelled.  I wasn't sure where the Latin came from. I think it meant ""Eat my pants!""  Thunder shook the bus. The hair rose on the back of my neck.  ""Get out!"" Annabeth yelled at me. ""Now!"" I didn't need any encouragement.  We rushed outside and found the other passengers wandering around in a daze, arguing with the driver, or running around in circles yelling, ""We're going to die!"" A Hawaiian-shirted tourist with a camera snapped my photograph before I could recap my sword.  ""Our bags!"" Grover realized. ""We left our—""  BOOOOOM!  The windows of the bus exploded as the passengers ran for cover. Lightning shredded a huge crater in the roof, but an angry wail from inside told me Mrs. Dodds was not yet dead.  ""Run!"" Annabeth said. ""She's calling for reinforcements! We have to get out of here!""  We plunged into the woods as the rain poured down, the bus in flames behind us, and nothing but darkness ahead."
Percy Jackson 1 Chapter 11,"In a way, it's nice to know there are Greek gods out there, because you have somebody to blame when things go wrong. For instance, when you're walking away from a bus that's just been attacked by monster hags and blown up by lightning, and it's raining on top of everything else, most people might think that's just really bad luck; when you're a half-blood, you understand that some divine force really is trying to mess up your day.  So there we were, Annabeth and Grover and I, walking through the woods along the New Jersey riverbank, the glow of New York City making the night sky yellow behind us, and the smell of the Hudson reeking in our noses.  Grover was shivering and braying, his big goat eyes turned slit-pupiled and full of terror. ""Three Kindly Ones. All three at once.""  I was pretty much in shock myself. The explosion of bus windows still rang in my ears. But Annabeth kept pulling us along, saying: ""Come on! The farther away we get, the better.""  ""All our money was back there,"" I reminded her. ""Our food and clothes. Everything.""  ""Well, maybe if you hadn't decided to jump into the fight—""  ""What did you want me to do? Let you get killed?""  ""You didn't need to protect me, Percy. I would've been fine.""  ""Sliced like sandwich bread,"" Grover put in, ""but fine.""  ""Shut up, goat boy,"" said Annabeth.  Grover brayed mournfully. ""Tin cans ... a perfectly good bag of tin cans.""  We sloshed across mushy ground, through nasty twisted trees that smelled like sour laundry.  After a few minutes, Annabeth fell into line next to me. ""Look, I..."" Her voice faltered. ""I appreciate your coming back for us, okay? That was really brave.""  ""We're a team, right?""  She was silent for a few more steps. ""It's just that if you died ... aside from the fact that it would really suck for you, it would mean the quest was over. This may be my only chance to see the real world.""  The thunderstorm had finally let up. The city glow faded behind us, leaving us in almost total darkness. I couldn't see anything of Annabeth except a glint of her blond hair.  ""You haven't left CampHalf-Blood since you were seven?"" I asked her.  ""No ... only short field trips. My dad—""  ""The history professor.""  ""Yeah. It didn't work out for me living at home. I mean, CampHalf-Bloodis my home."" She was rushing her words out now, as if she were afraid somebody might try to stop her.  ""At camp you train and train. And that's all cool and everything, but the real world is where the monsters are. That's where you learn whether you're any good or not.""  If I didn't know better, I could've sworn I heard doubt in her voice.  ""You're pretty good with that knife,"" I said.  ""You think so?""  ""Anybody who can piggyback-ride a Fury is okay by me.""  I couldn't really see, but I thought she might've smiled.  ""You know,"" she said, ""maybe I should tell you ... Something funny back on the bus ...""  Whatever she wanted to say was interrupted by a shrill toot-toot-toot, like the sound of an owl being tortured.  ""Hey, my reed pipes still work!"" Grover cried. ""If I could just remember a 'find path' song, we could get out of these woods!"". . . . . . . ..  He puffed out a few notes, but the tune still sounded suspiciously like Hilary Duff.  Instead of finding a path, I immediately slammed into a tree and got a nice-size knot on my head.  Add to the list of superpowers I did not have: infrared vision.  After tripping and cursing and generally feeling miserable for another mile or so, I started to see light up ahead: the colors of a neon sign. I could smell food. Fried, greasy, excellent food. I realized I hadn't eaten anything unhealthy since I'd arrived at Half-Blood Hill, where we lived on grapes, bread, cheese, and extra-lean-cut nymph-prepared barbecue. This boy needed a double cheeseburger.  We kept walking until I saw a deserted two-lane road through the trees. On the other side was a closed-down gas station, a tattered billboard for a 1990s movie, and one open business, which was the source of the neon light and the good smell.  It wasn't a fast-food restaurant like I'd hoped. It was one of those weird roadside curio shops that sell lawn flamingos and wooden Indians and cement grizzly bears and stuff like that. The main building was a long, low warehouse, surrounded by acres of statuary. The neon sign above the gate was impossible for me to read, because if there's anything worse for my dyslexia than regular English, it's red cursive neon English. To me, it looked like: ATNYU MES GDERAN GOMEN MEPROUIM.  ""What the heck does that say?"" I asked.  ""I don't know,"" Annabeth said.  She loved reading so much, I'd forgotten she was dyslexic, too.  Grover translated: ""Aunty Em's Garden Gnome Emporium.""  Flanking the entrance, as advertised, were two cement garden gnomes, ugly bearded little runts, smiling and waving, as if they were about to get their picture taken.  I crossed the street, following the smell of the hamburgers.  ""Hey ..."" Grover warned.  ""The lights are on inside,"" Annabeth said. ""Maybe it's open.""  ""Snack bar,"" I said wistfully.  ""Snack bar,"" she agreed.  ""Are you two crazy?"" Grover said. ""This place is weird.""  We ignored him.  The front lot was a forest of statues: cement animals, cement children, even a cement satyr playing the pipes, which gave Grover the creeps.  ""Bla-ha-ha!"" he bleated. ""Looks like my Uncle Ferdinand!""  We stopped at the warehouse door.  ""Don't knock,"" Grover pleaded. ""I smell monsters.""  ""Your nose is clogged up from the Furies,"" Annabeth told him. ""All I smell is burgers. Aren't you hungry?""  ""Meat!"" he said scornfully. ""I'm a vegetarian.""  ""You eat cheese enchiladas and aluminum cans,"" I reminded him..  ""Those are vegetables. Come on. Let's leave. These statues are ... looking at me.""  Then the door creaked open, and standing in front of us was a tall Middle Eastern woman—at least, I assumed she was Middle Eastern, because she wore a long black gown that covered everything but her hands, and her head was completely veiled. Her eyes glinted behind a curtain of black gauze, but that was about all I could make out. Her coffee-colored hands looked old, but well-manicured and elegant, so I imagined she was a grandmother who had once been a beautiful lady.  Her accent sounded vaguely Middle Eastern, too. She said, ""Children, it is too late to be out all alone. Where are your parents?""  ""They're ... um ..."" Annabeth started to say.  ""We're orphans,"" I said.  ""Orphans?"" the woman said. The word sounded alien in her mouth. ""But, my dears! Surely not!""  ""We got separated from our caravan,"" I said. ""Our circus caravan. The ringmaster told us to meet him at the gas station if we got lost, but he may have forgotten, or maybe he meant a different gas station. Anyway, we're lost. Is that food I smell?""  ""Oh, my dears,"" the woman said. ""You must come in, poor children. I am Aunty Em. Go straight through to the back of the warehouse, please. There is a dining area.""  We thanked her and went inside.  Annabeth muttered to me, ""Circus caravan?""  ""Always have a strategy, right?""  ""Your head is full of kelp.""  The warehouse was filled with more statues—people in all different poses, wearing all different outfits and with different expressions on their faces. I was thinking you'd have to have a pretty huge garden to fit even one of these statues, because they were all life-size. But mostly, I was thinking about food.  Go ahead, call me an idiot for walking into a strange lady's shop like that just because I was hungry, but I do impulsive stuff sometimes. Plus, you've never smelled Aunty Em's burgers. The aroma was like laughing gas in the dentist's chair—it made everything else go away.  I barely noticed Grover's nervous whimpers, or the way the statues' eyes seemed to follow me, or the fact that Aunty Em had locked the door behind us.  All I cared about was finding the dining area. And sure enough, there it was at the back of the warehouse, a fast-food counter with a grill, a soda fountain, a pretzel heater, and a nacho cheese dispenser. Everything you could want, plus a few steel picnic tables out front.  ""Please, sit down,"" Aunty Em said.  ""Awesome,"" I said.  ""Um,"" Grover said reluctantly, ""we don't have any money, ma'am.""  Before I could jab him in the ribs, Aunty Em said, ""No, no, children. No money. This is a special case, yes? It is my treat, for such nice orphans.""  ""Thank you, ma'am,"" Annabeth said.  Aunty Em stiffened, as if Annabeth had done something wrong, but then the old woman relaxed just as quickly, so I figured it must've been my imagination.  ""Quite all right, Annabeth,"" she said. ""You have such beautiful gray eyes, child."" Only later did I wonder how she knew Annabeth's name, even though we had never introduced ourselves.  Our hostess disappeared behind the snack counter and started cooking. Before we knew it, she'd brought us plastic trays heaped with double cheeseburgers, vanilla shakes, and XXL servings of French fries.  I was halfway through my burger before I remembered to breathe.  Annabeth slurped her shake.  Grover picked at the fries, and eyed the tray's waxed paper liner as if he might go for that, but he still looked too nervous to eat.  ""What's that hissing noise?"" he asked.  I listened, but didn't hear anything. Annabeth shook her head.  ""Hissing?"" Aunty Em asked. ""Perhaps you hear the deep-fryer oil. You have keen ears, Grover.""  ""I take vitamins. For my ears.""  ""That's admirable,"" she said. ""But please, relax.""  Aunty Em ate nothing. She hadn't taken off her headdress, even to cook, and now she sat forward and interlaced her fingers and watched us eat. It was a little unsettling, having someone stare at me when I couldn't see her face, but I was feeling satisfied after the burger, and a little sleepy, and I figured the least I could do was try to make small talk with our hostess.  ""So, you sell gnomes,"" I said, trying to sound interested.  ""Oh, yes,"" Aunty Em said. ""And animals. And people. Anything for the garden. Custom orders. Statuary is very popular, you know.""  ""A lot of business on this road?""  ""Not so much, no. Since the highway was built... most cars, they do not go this way now. I must cherish every customer I get.""  My neck tingled, as if somebody else was looking at me. I turned, but it was just a statue of a young girl holding an Easter basket. The detail was incredible, much better than you see in most garden statues. But something was wrong with her face. It looked as if she were startled, or even terrified.  ""Ah,"" Aunty Em said sadly. ""You notice some of my creations do not turn out well. They are marred. They do not sell. The face is the hardest to get right. Always the face.""  ""You make these statues yourself?"" I asked.  ""Oh, yes. Once upon a time, I had two sisters to help me in the business, but they have passed on, and Aunty Em is alone. I have only my statues. This is why I make them, you see. They are my company."" The sadness in her voice sounded so deep and so real that I couldn't help feeling sorry for her.  Annabeth had stopped eating. She sat forward and said, ""Two sisters?""  ""It's a terrible story,"" Aunty Em said. ""Not one for children, really. You see, Annabeth, a bad woman was jealous of me, long ago, when I was young. I had a... a boyfriend, you know, and this bad woman was determined to break us apart. She caused a terrible accident. My sisters stayed by me. They shared my bad fortune as long as they could, but eventually they passed on. They faded away. I alone have survived, but at a price. Such a price.""  I wasn't sure what she meant, but I felt bad for her. My eyelids kept getting heavier, my full stomach making me sleepy. Poor old lady. Who would want to hurt somebody so nice?  ""Percy?"" Annabeth was shaking me to get my attention. ""Maybe we should go. I mean, the ringmaster will be waiting.""  She sounded tense. I wasn't sure why. Grover was eating the waxed paper off the tray now, but if Aunty Em found that strange, she didn't say anything.  ""Such beautiful gray eyes,"" Aunty Em told Annabeth again. ""My, yes, it has been a long time since I've seen gray eyes like those.""  She reached out as if to stroke Annabeth's cheek, but Annabeth stood up abruptly.  ""We really should go.""  ""Yes!"" Grover swallowed his waxed paper and stood up. ""The ringmaster is waiting! Right!""  I didn't want to leave. I felt full and content. Aunty Em was so nice. I wanted to stay with her a while.  ""Please, dears,"" Aunty Em pleaded. ""I so rarely get to be with children. Before you go, won't you at least sit for a pose?""  ""A pose?"" Annabeth asked warily.  ""A photograph. I will use it to model a new statue set. Children are so popular, you see. Everyone loves children.""  Annabeth shifted her weight from foot to foot. ""I don't think we can, ma'am. Come on, Percy—""  ""Sure we can,"" I said. I was irritated with Annabeth for being so bossy, so rude to an old lady who'd just fed us for free. ""It's just a photo, Annabeth. What's the harm?""  ""Yes, Annabeth,"" the woman purred. ""No harm.""  I could tell Annabeth didn't like it, but she allowed Aunty Em to lead us back out the front door, into the garden of statues.  Aunty Em directed us to a park bench next to the stone satyr. ""Now,"" she said, ""I'll just position you correctly. The young girl in the middle, I think, and the two young gentlemen on either side.""  ""Not much light for a photo,"" I remarked.  ""Oh, enough,"" Aunty Em said. ""Enough for us to see each other, yes?""  ""Where's your camera?"" Grover asked.  Aunty Em stepped back, as if to admire the shot. ""Now, the face is the most difficult. Can you smile for me please, everyone? A large smile?""  Grover glanced at the cement satyr next to him, and mumbled, ""That sure does look like Uncle Ferdinand.""  ""Grover,"" Aunty Em chastised, ""look this way, dear.""  She still had no camera in her hands.  ""Percy—"" Annabeth said.  Some instinct warned me to listen to Annabeth, but I was fighting the sleepy feeling, the comfortable lull that came from the food and the old lady's voice.  ""I will just be a moment,"" Aunty Em said. ""You know, I can't see you very well in this cursed veil....""  ""Percy, something's wrong,"" Annabeth insisted.  ""Wrong?"" Aunty Em said, reaching up to undo the wrap around her head. ""Not at all, dear. I have such noble company tonight. What could be wrong?""  ""That is Uncle Ferdinand!"" Grover gasped.  ""Look away from her!"" Annabeth shouted. She whipped her Yankees cap onto her head and vanished. Her invisible hands pushed Grover and me both off the bench.  I was on the ground, looking at Aunt Em's sandaled feet.  I could hear Grover scrambling off in one direction, Annabeth in another. But I was too dazed to move.  Then I heard a strange, rasping sound above me. My eyes rose to Aunty Em's hands, which had turned gnarled and warty, with sharp bronze talons for fingernails.  I almost looked higher, but somewhere off to my left Annabeth screamed, ""No! Don't!""  More rasping—the sound of tiny snakes, right above me, from ... from about where Aunty Em's head would be.  ""Run!"" Grover bleated. I heard him racing across the gravel, yelling, ""Maia!"" to kick-start his flying sneakers. I couldn't move. I stared at Aunty Em's gnarled claws, and tried to fight the groggy trance the old woman had put me in.  ""Such a pity to destroy a handsome young face,"" she told me soothingly. ""Stay with me, Percy. All you have to do is look up.""  I fought the urge to obey. Instead I looked to one side and saw one of those glass spheres people put in gardens— a gazing ball. I could see Aunty Em's dark reflection in the orange glass; her headdress was gone, revealing her face as a shimmering pale circle. Her hair was moving, writhing like serpents.  Aunty Em.  Aunty ""M.""  How could I have been so stupid?  Think, I told myself. How did Medusa die in the myth?  But I couldn't think. Something told me that in the myth Medusa had been asleep when she was attacked by my namesake, Perseus. She wasn't anywhere near asleep now. If she wanted, she could take those talons right now and rake open my face.  ""The Gray-Eyed One did this to me, Percy,"" Medusa said, and she didn't sound anything like a monster. Her voice invited me to look up, to sympathize with a poor old grandmother. ""Annabeth's mother, the cursed Athena, turned me from a beautiful woman into this.""  ""Don't listen to her!"" Annabeth's voice shouted, somewhere in the statuary. ""Run, Percy!""  ""Silence!"" Medusa snarled. Then her voice modulated back to a comforting purr. ""You see why I must destroy the girl, Percy. She is my enemy's daughter. I shall crush her statue to dust. But you, dear Percy, you need not suffer.""  ""No,"" I muttered. I tried to make my legs move...  ""Do you really want to help the gods?"" Medusa asked. ""Do you understand what awaits you on this foolish quest, Percy? What will happen if you reach the Underworld? Do not be a pawn of the Olympians, my dear. You would be better off as a statue. Less pain. Less pain.""  ""Percy!"" Behind me, I heard a buzzing sound, like a two-hundred-pound hummingbird in a nosedive. Grover yelled, ""Duck!""  I turned, and there he was in the night sky, flying in from twelve o'clock with his winged  shoes fluttering, Grover, holding a tree branch the size of a baseball bat. His eyes were shut tight, his head twitched from side to side. He was navigating by ears and nose alone.  ""Duck!"" he yelled again. ""I'll get her!""  That finally jolted me into action. Knowing Grover, I was sure he'd miss Medusa and nail me. I dove to one side.  Thwack!  At first I figured it was the sound of Grover hitting a tree. Then Medusa roared with rage.  ""You miserable satyr,"" she snarled. ""I'll add you to my collection!""  ""That was for Uncle Ferdinand!"" Grover yelled back.  I scrambled away and hid in the statuary while Grover swooped down for another pass.  Ker-whack!  ""Arrgh!"" Medusa yelled, her snake-hair hissing and spitting.  Right next to me, Annabeth's voice said, ""Percy!""  I jumped so high my feet nearly cleared a garden gnome. ""Jeez! Don't do that!""  Annabeth took off her Yankees cap and became visible. 'You have to cut her head off.""  ""What? Are you crazy? Let's get out of here.""  ""Medusa is a menace. She's evil. I'd kill her myself, but..."" Annabeth swallowed, as if she were about to make a difficult admission. ""But you've got the better weapon. Besides, I'd never get close to her. She'd slice me to bits because of my mother. You—you've got a chance.""  ""What? I can't—""  ""Look, do you want her turning more innocent people into statues?""  She pointed to a pair of statue lovers, a man and a woman with their arms around each other, turned to stone by the monster.  Annabeth grabbed a green gazing ball from a nearby pedestal. ""A polished shield would be better."" She studied the sphere critically. ""The convexity will cause some distortion. The reflection's size should be off by a factor of—""  ""Would you speak English?""  ""I am!"" She tossed me the glass ball. ""Just look at her in the glass. Never look at her directly.""  ""Hey, guys!"" Grover yelled somewhere above us. ""I think she's unconscious!""  ""Roooaaarrr!""  ""Maybe not,"" Grover corrected. He went in for another pass with the tree branch.  ""Hurry,"" Annabeth told me. ""Grover's got a great nose, but he'll eventually crash."".  I took out my pen and uncapped it. The bronze blade of Riptide elongated in my hand.  I followed the hissing and spitting sounds of Medusa's hair.  I kept my eyes locked on the gazing ball so I would only glimpse Medusa's reflection, not the real thing. Then, in the green tinted glass, I saw her.  Grover was coming in for another turn at bat, but this time he flew a little too low. Medusa grabbed the stick and pulled him off course. He tumbled through the air and crashed into the arms of a stone grizzly bear with a painful ""Ummphh!""  Medusa was about to lunge at him when I yelled, ""Hey!""  I advanced on her, which wasn't easy, holding a sword and a glass ball. If she charged, I'd have a hard time defending myself.  But she let me approach—twenty feet, ten feet.  I could see the reflection of her face now. Surely it wasn't really that ugly. The green swirls of the gazing ball must be distorting it, making it look worse.  ""You wouldn't harm an old woman, Percy,"" she crooned. ""I know you wouldn't.""  I hesitated, fascinated by the face I saw reflected in the glass—the eyes that seemed to burn straight through the green tint, making my arms go weak.  From the cement grizzly, Grover moaned, ""Percy, don't listen to her!""  Medusa cackled. ""Too late.""  She lunged at me with her talons.  I slashed up with my sword, heard a sickening shlock!, then a hiss like wind rushing out of a cavern—the sound of a monster disintegrating.  Something fell to the ground next to my foot. It took all my willpower not to look. I could feel warm ooze soaking into my sock, little dying snake heads tugging at my shoelaces.  ""Oh, yuck,"" Grover said. His eyes were still tightly closed, but I guess he could hear the thing gurgling and steaming. ""Mega-yuck.""  Annabeth came up next to me, her eyes fixed on the sky. She was holding Medusa's black veil. She said, ""Don't move.""  Very, very carefully, without looking down, she knelt and draped the monster's head in black cloth, then picked it up. It was still dripping green juice.  ""Are you okay?"" she asked me, her voice trembling.  ""Yeah,"" I decided, though I felt like throwing up my double cheeseburger. ""Why didn't ... why didn't the head evaporate?""  ""Once you sever it, it becomes a spoil of war,"" she said. ""Same as your minotaur horn. But don't unwrap the head. It can still petrify you.""  Grover moaned as he climbed down from the grizzly statue. He had a big welt on his forehead. His green rasta cap hung from one of his little goat horns, and his fake feet had been knocked off his hooves. The magic sneakers were flying aimlessly around his head.  ""The Red Baron,"" I said. ""Good job, man.""  He managed a bashful grin. ""That really was not fun, though. Well, the hitting-her-with-a-stick part, that was fun. But crashing into a concrete bear? Not fun.""  He snatched his shoes out of the air. I recapped my sword. Together, the three of us stumbled back to the warehouse.  We found some old plastic grocery bags behind the snack counter and double-wrapped Medusa's head. We plopped it on the table where we'd eaten dinner and sat around it, too exhausted to speak.  Finally I said, ""So we have Athena to thank for this monster?""  Annabeth flashed me an irritated look. ""Your dad, actually. Don't you remember? Medusa was Poseidon's girlfriend. They decided to meet in my mother's temple. That's why Athena turned her into a monster. Medusa and her two sisters who had helped her get into the temple, they became the three gorgons. That's why Medusa wanted to slice me up, but she wanted to preserve you as a nice statue. She's still sweet on your dad. You probably reminded her of him.""  My face was burning. ""Oh, so now it's my fault we met Medusa.""  Annabeth straightened. In a bad imitation of my voice, she said: ""'It's just a photo, Annabeth. What's the harm?'""  ""Forget it,"" I said. ""You're impossible.""  ""You're insufferable.""  ""You're—""  ""Hey!"" Grover interrupted. ""You two are giving me a migraine, and satyrs don't even get migraines. What are we going to do with the head?""  I stared at the thing. One little snake was hanging out of a hole in the plastic. The words printed on the side of the bag said: WE APPRECIATE YOUR BUSINESS!  I was angry, not just with Annabeth or her mom, but with all the gods for this whole quest, for getting us blown off the road and in two major fights the very first day out from camp. At this rate, we'd never make it to L.A. alive, much less before the summer solstice.  What had Medusa said?  Do not be a pawn of the Olympians, my dear. You would be better off as a statue.  I got up. ""I'll be back.""  ""Percy,"" Annabeth called after me. ""What are you—""  I searched the back of the warehouse until I found Medusa's office. Her account book showed her six most recent sales, all shipments to the Underworld to decorate Hades and Persephone's garden. According to one freight bill, the Underworld's billing address was DOA Recording Studios, West Hollywood, California. I folded up the bill and stuffed it in my pocket.  In the cash register I found twenty dollars, a few golden drachmas, and some packing slips for Hermes Overnight Express, each with a little leather bag attached for coins. I rummaged around the rest of the office until I found the right-size box.  I went back to the picnic table, packed up Medusa's head, and filled out a delivery slip:  The Gods  Mount Olympus  600th Floor,  Empire StateBuilding  New York, NY  With best wishes,  PERCY JACKSON  ""They're not going to like that,"" Grover warned. ""They'll think you're impertinent.""  I poured some golden drachmas in the pouch. As soon as I closed it, there was a sound like a cash register. The package floated off the table and disappeared with a pop!  ""I am impertinent,"" I said.  I looked at Annabeth, daring her to criticize.  She didn't. She seemed resigned to the fact that I had a major talent for ticking off the gods. ""Come on,"" she muttered. ""We need a new plan."""
Percy Jackson 1 Chapter 12,"We were pretty miserable that night.  We camped out in the woods, a hundred yards from the main road, in a marshy clearing that local kids had obviously been using for parties. The ground was littered with flattened soda cans and fast-food wrappers.  We'd taken some food and blankets from Aunty Em's, but we didn't dare light a fire to dry our damp clothes. The Furies and Medusa had provided enough excitement for one day. We didn't want to attract anything else.  We decided to sleep in shifts. I volunteered to take first watch.  Annabeth curled up on the blankets and was snoring as soon as her head hit the ground. Grover fluttered with his flying shoes to the lowest bough of a tree, put his back to the trunk, and stared at the night sky. ""Go ahead and sleep,"" I told him. ""I'll wake you if there's trouble.""  He nodded, but still didn't close his eyes. ""It makes me sad, Percy.""  ""What does? The fact that you signed up for this stupid quest?""  ""No. This makes me sad."" He pointed at all the garbage on the ground. ""And the sky. You can't even see the stars. They've polluted the sky. This is a terrible time to be a satyr.""  ""Oh, yeah. I guess you'd be an environmentalist.""  He glared at me. ""Only a human wouldn't be. Your species is clogging up the world so fast ... ah, never mind. It's useless to lecture a human. At the rate things are going, I'll never find Pan.""  ""Pam? Like the cooking spray?""  ""Pan!"" he cried indignantly. ""P-A-N. The great god Pan! What do you think I want a searcher's license for?""  A strange breeze rustled through the clearing, temporarily overpowering the stink of trash and muck. It brought the smell of berries and wildflowers and clean rainwater, things that might've once been in these woods. Suddenly I was nostalgic for something I'd never known.  ""Tell me about the search,"" I said.  Grover looked at me cautiously, as if he were afraid I was just making fun.  ""The God of Wild Places disappeared two thousand years ago,"" he told me. ""A sailor off the coast of Ephesos heard a mysterious voice crying out from the shore, 'Tell them that the great god Pan has died!' When humans heard the news, they believed it. They've been pillaging Pan's kingdom ever since. But for the satyrs, Pan was our lord and master. He protected us and the wild places of the earth. We refuse to believe that he died. In every generation, the bravest satyrs pledge their lives to finding Pan. They search the earth, exploring all the wildest places, hoping to find where he is hidden, and wake him from his sleep.""  ""And you want to be a searcher.""  ""It's my life's dream,"" he said. ""My father was a searcher. And my Uncle Ferdinand ... the statue you saw back there—""  ""Oh, right, sorry.""  Grover shook his head. ""Uncle Ferdinand knew the risks. So did my dad. But I'll succeed. I'll be the first searcher to return alive.""  ""Hang on—the first?""  Grover took his reed pipes out of his pocket. ""No searcher has ever come back. Once they set out, they disappear. They're never seen alive again.""  ""Not once in two thousand years?""  ""No.""  ""And your dad? You have no idea what happened to him?""  ""None.""  ""But you still want to go,"" I said, amazed. ""I mean, you really think you'll be the one to find Pan?""  ""I have to believe that, Percy. Every searcher does. It's the only thing that keeps us from despair when we look at what humans have done to the world. I have to believe Pan can still be awakened.""  I stared at the orange haze of the sky and tried to understand how Grover could pursue a dream that seemed so hopeless. Then again, was I any better?  ""How are we going to get into the Underworld?"" I asked him. ""I mean, what chance do we have against a god?""  ""I don't know,"" he admitted. ""But back at Medusa's, when you were searching her office? Annabeth was telling me—""  ""Oh, I forgot. Annabeth will have a plan all figured out.""  ""Don't be so hard on her, Percy. She's had a tough life, but she's a good person. After all, she forgave me...."" His voice faltered.  ""What do you mean?"" I asked. ""Forgave you for what?""  Suddenly, Grover seemed very interested in playing notes on his pipes.  ""Wait a minute,"" I said. ""Your first keeper job was five years ago. Annabeth has been at camp five years. She wasn't ... I mean, your first assignment that went wrong—""  ""I can't talk about it,"" Grover said, and his quivering lower lip suggested he'd start crying if I pressed him. ""But as I was saying, back at Medusa's, Annabeth and I agreed there's something strange going on with this quest. Something isn't what it seems.""  ""Well, duh. I'm getting blamed for stealing a thunderbolt that Hades took.""  ""That's not what I mean,"" Grover said. ""The Fur—The Kindly Ones were sort of holding back. Like Mrs. Dodds at YancyAcademy ... why did she wait so long to try to kill you? Then on the bus, they just weren't as aggressive as they could've been.""  ""They seemed plenty aggressive to me.""  Grover shook his head. ""They were screeching at us: 'Where is it? Where?'""  ""Asking about me,"" I said.  ""Maybe ... but Annabeth and I, we both got the feeling they weren't asking about a person. They said 'Where is it?'  They seemed to be asking about an object.""  ""That doesn't make sense.""  ""I know. But if we've misunderstood something about this quest, and we only have nine days to find the master bolt...."" He looked at me like he was hoping for answers, but I didn't have any.  I thought about what Medusa had said: I was being used by the gods. What lay ahead of me was worse than petrification. ""I haven't been straight with you,"" 1 told Grover. ""I don't care about the master bolt. I agreed to go to the Underworld so I could bring back my mother.""  Grover blew a soft note on his pipes. ""I know that, Percy. But are you sure that's the only reason?""  ""I'm not doing it to help my father. He doesn't care about me. I don't care about him.""  Grover gazed down from his tree branch. ""Look, Percy, I'm not as smart as Annabeth. I'm not as brave as you. But I'm pretty good at reading emotions. You're glad your dad is alive. You feel good that he's claimed you, and part of you wants to make him proud. That's why you mailed Medusa's head to Olympus. You wanted him to notice what you'd done.""  ""Yeah? Well maybe satyr emotions work differently than human emotions. Because you're wrong. I don't care what he thinks.""  Grover pulled his feet up onto the branch. ""Okay, Percy. Whatever.""  ""Besides, I haven't done anything worth bragging about. We barely got out of New York and we're stuck here with no money and no way west.""  Grover looked at the night sky, like he was thinking about that problem. ""How about I take first watch, huh? You get some sleep.""  I wanted to protest, but he started to play Mozart, soft and sweet, and I turned away, my eyes stinging. After a few bars of Piano Concerto no. 12, I was asleep.  In my dreams, I stood in a dark cavern before a gaping pit. Gray mist creatures churned all around me, whispering rags of smoke that I somehow knew were the spirits of the dead.  They tugged at my clothes, trying to pull me back, but I felt compelled to walk forward to the very edge of the chasm.  Looking down made me dizzy.  The pit yawned so wide and was so completely black, I knew it must be bottomless. Yet I had a feeling that something was trying to rise from the abyss, something huge and evil.  The little hero, an amused voice echoed far down in the darkness. Too weak, too young, but perhaps you will do.  The voice felt ancient—cold and heavy. It wrapped around me like sheets of lead.  They have misled you, boy, it said. Barter with me. I will give you what you want.  A shimmering image hovered over the void: my mother, frozen at the moment she'd dissolved in a shower of gold. Her face was distorted with pain, as if the Minotaur were still squeezing her neck. Her eyes looked directly at me, pleading: Go!  I tried to cry out, but my voice wouldn't work.  Cold laughter echoed from the chasm.  An invisible force pulled me forward. It would drag me into the pit unless I stood firm.  Help me rise, boy. The voice became hungrier. Bring me the bolt. Strike a blow against the treacherous gods!  The spirits of the dead whispered around me, No! Wake!  The image of my mother began to fade. The thing in the pit tightened its unseen grip around me.  I realized it wasn't interested in pulling me in. It was using me to pull itself out.  Good, it murmured. Good.  Wake! the dead whispered. Wake!  Someone was shaking me.  My eyes opened, and it was daylight.  ""Well,"" Annabeth said, ""the zombie lives.""  I was trembling from the dream. I could still feel the grip of the chasm monster around my chest. ""How long was I asleep?""  ""Long enough for me to cook breakfast."" Annabeth tossed me a bag of nacho-flavored corn chips from Aunty Em's snack bar. ""And Grover went exploring. Look, he found a friend.""  My eyes had trouble focusing.  Grover was sitting cross-legged on a blanket with something fuzzy in his lap, a dirty, unnaturally pink stuffed animal.  No. It wasn't a stuffed animal. It was a pink poodle.  The poodle yapped at me suspiciously. Grover said, ""No, he's not.""  I blinked. ""Are you ... talking to that thing?""  The poodle growled.  ""This thing,"" Grover warned, ""is our ticket west. Be nice to him.""  ""You can talk to animals?""  Grover ignored the question. ""Percy, meet Gladiola. Gladiola, Percy.""  I stared at Annabeth, figuring she'd crack up at this practical joke they were playing on me, but she looked deadly serious.  ""I'm not saying hello to a pink poodle,"" I said. ""Forget it.""  ""Percy,"" Annabeth said. ""I said hello to the poodle. You say hello to the poodle.""  The poodle growled.  I said hello to the poodle.  Grover explained that he'd come across Gladiola in the woods and they'd struck up a conversation. The poodle had run away from a rich local family, who'd posted a $200 reward for his return. Gladiola didn't really want to go back to his family, but he was willing to if it meant helping Grover.  ""How does Gladiola know about the reward?"" I asked.  ""He read the signs,"" Grover said. ""Duh.""  ""Of course,"" I said. ""Silly me.""  ""So we turn in Gladiola,"" Annabeth explained in her best strategy voice, ""we get money, and we buy tickets to Los Angeles. Simple.""  I thought about my dream—the whispering voices of the dead, the thing in the chasm, and my mother's face, shimmering as it dissolved into gold. All that might be waiting for me in the West.  ""Not another bus,"" I said warily.  ""No,"" Annabeth agreed.  She pointed downhill, toward train tracks I hadn't been able to see last night in the dark. ""There's an Amtrak station half a mile that way. According to Gladiola, the westbound train leaves at noon."""
Percy Jackson 1 Chapter 13,"We spent two days on the Amtrak train, heading west through hills, over rivers, past amber waves of grain.  We weren't attacked once, but I didn't relax. I felt that we were traveling around in a display case, being watched from above and maybe from below, that something was waiting for the right opportunity.  I tried to keep a low profile because my name and picture were splattered over the front pages of several East Coast newspapers. The Trenton Register-News showed a photo taken by a tourist as I got off the Greyhound bus. I had a wild look in my eyes. My sword was a metallic blur in my hands. It might've been a baseball bat or a lacrosse stick.  The picture's caption read:  Twelve-year-old Percy Jackson, wanted for questioning in the Long Island disappearance of his mother two weeks ago, is shown here fleeing from the bus where he accosted several elderly female passengers. The bus exploded on an east New Jersey roadside shortly after Jackson fled the scene. Based on eyewitness accounts, police believe the boy may be traveling with two teenage accomplices. His stepfather, Gabe Ugliano, has offered a cash reward for information leading to his capture. ""Don't worry,"" Annabeth told me. ""Mortal police could never find us."" But she didn't sound so sure.  The rest of the day I spent alternately pacing the length of the train (because I had a really hard time sitting still) or looking out the windows.  Once, I spotted a family of centaurs galloping across a wheat field, bows at the ready, as they hunted lunch. The little boy centaur, who was the size of a second-grader on a pony, caught my eye and waved. I looked around the passenger car, but nobody else had noticed. The adult riders all had their faces buried in laptop computers or magazines.  Another time, toward evening, I saw something huge moving through the woods. I could've sworn it was a lion, except that lions don't live wild in America, and this thing was the size of a Hummer. Its fur glinted gold in the evening light. Then it leaped through the trees and was gone.  Our reward money for returning Gladiola the poodle had only been enough to purchase tickets as far as Denver. We couldn't get berths in the sleeper car, so we dozed in our seats. My neck got stiff. I tried not to drool in my sleep, since Annabeth was sitting right next to me.  Grover kept snoring and bleating and waking me up. Once, he shuffled around and his fake foot fell off. Annabeth and I had to stick it back on before any of the other passengers noticed.  ""So,"" Annabeth asked me, once we'd gotten Grover's sneaker readjusted. ""Who wants your help?""  ""What do you mean?""  ""When you were asleep just now, you mumbled, 'I won't help you.' Who were you dreaming about?""  I was reluctant to say anything. It was the second time I'd dreamed about the evil voice from the pit. But it bothered me so much I finally told her.  Annabeth was quiet for a long time. ""That doesn't sound like Hades. He always appears on a black throne, and he never laughs.""  ""He offered my mother in trade. Who else could do that?""  ""I guess ... if he meant, 'Help me rise from the Underworld.' If he wants war with the Olympians. But why ask you to bring him the master bolt if he already has it?""  I shook my head, wishing I knew the answer. I thought about what Grover had told me, that the Furies on the bus seemed to have been looking for something.  Where is it? Where?  Maybe Grover sensed my emotions. He snorted in his sleep, muttered something about vegetables, and turned his head.  Annabeth readjusted his cap so it covered his horns. ""Percy, you can't barter with Hades. You know that, right? He's deceitful, heartless, and greedy. I don't care if his Kindly Ones weren't as aggressive this time—""  ""This time?"" I asked. ""You mean you've run into them before?""  Her hand crept up to her necklace. She fingered a glazed white bead painted with the image of a pine tree, one of her clay end-of-summer tokens. ""Let's just say I've got no love for the Lord of the Dead. You can't be tempted to make a deal for your mom.""  ""What would you do if it was your dad?""  ""That's easy,"" she said. ""I'd leave him to rot.""  ""You're not serious?""  Annabeth's gray eyes fixed on me. She wore the same expression she'd worn in the woods at camp, the moment she drew her sword against the hellhound. ""My dad's resented me since the day I was born, Percy,"" she said. ""He never wanted a baby. When he got me, he asked Athena to take me back and raise me on Olympus because he was too busy with his work. She wasn't happy about that. She told him heroes had to be raised by their mortal parent.""  ""But how ... I mean, I guess you weren't born in a hospital....""  ""I appeared on my father's doorstep, in a golden cradle, carried down from Olympus by Zephyr the West Wind. You'd think my dad would remember that as a miracle, right? Like, maybe he'd take some digital photos or something. But he always talked about my arrival as if it were the most inconvenient thing that had ever happened to him. When I was five he got married and totally forgot about Athena. He got a 'regular' mortal wife, and had two 'regular' mortal kids, and tried to pretend I didn't exist.""  I stared out the train window. The lights of a sleeping town were drifting by. I wanted to make Annabeth feel better, but I didn't know how.  ""My mom married a really awful guy,"" I told her. ""Grover said she did it to protect me, to hide me in the scent of a human family. Maybe that's what your dad was thinking.""  Annabeth kept worrying at her necklace. She was pinching the gold college ring that hung with the beads. It occurred to me that the ring must be her father's. I wondered why she wore it if she hated him so much.  ""He doesn't care about me,"" she said. ""His wife—my stepmom—treated me like a freak. She wouldn't let me play with her children. My dad went along with her. Whenever something dangerous happened—you know, something with monsters—they would both look at me resentfully, like, 'How dare you put our family at risk.' Finally, I took the hint. I wasn't wanted. I ran away.""  ""How old were you?""  ""Same age as when I started camp. Seven.""  ""But ... you couldn't have gotten all the way to Half-Blood Hill by yourself.""  ""Not alone, no. Athena watched over me, guided me toward help. I made a couple of unexpected friends who took care of me, for a short time, anyway.""  I wanted to ask what happened, but Annabeth seemed lost in sad memories. So I listened to the sound of Grover snoring and gazed out the train windows as the dark fields of Ohio raced by.  Toward the end of our second day on the train, June 13, eight days before the summer solstice, we passed through some golden hills and over the Mississippi River into St. Louis. Annabeth craned her neck to see the Gateway Arch, which looked to me like a huge shopping bag handle stuck on the city.  ""I want to do that,"" she sighed.  ""What?"" I asked.  ""Build something like that. You ever see the Parthenon, Percy?""  ""Only in pictures.""  ""Someday, I'm going to see it in person. I'm going to build the greatest monument to the gods, ever. Something that'll last a thousand years.""  I laughed. ""You? An architect?""  I don't know why, but I found it funny. Just the idea of Annabeth trying to sit quietly and draw all day.  Her cheeks flushed. ""Yes, an architect. Athena expects her children to create things, not just tear them down, like a certain god of earthquakes I could mention.""  I watched the churning brown water of the Mississippi below.  ""Sorry,"" Annabeth said. ""That was mean.""  ""Can't we work together a little?"" I pleaded. ""I mean, didn't Athena and Poseidon ever cooperate?""  Annabeth had to think about it. ""I guess ... the chariot,"" she said tentatively. ""My mom invented it, but Poseidon created horses out of the crests of waves. So they had to work together to make it complete.""  ""Then we can cooperate, too. Right?""  We rode into the city, Annabeth watching as the Arch disappeared behind a hotel.  ""I suppose,"" she said at last.  We pulled into the Amtrak station downtown. The intercom told us we'd have a three-hour layover before departing for Denver.  Grover stretched. Before he was even fully awake, he said, ""Food.""  ""Come on, goat boy,"" Annabeth said. ""Sightseeing.""  ""Sightseeing?""  ""The Gateway Arch,"" she said. ""This may be my only chance to ride to the top. Are you coming or not?""  Grover and I exchanged looks.  I wanted to say no, but I figured that if Annabeth was going, we couldn't very well let her go alone.  Grover shrugged. ""As long as there's a snack bar without monsters.""  The Arch was about a mile from the train station. Late in the day the lines to get in weren't that long. We threaded our way through the underground museum, looking at covered wagons and other junk from the 1800s. It wasn't all that thrilling, but Annabeth kept telling us interesting facts about how the Arch was built, and Grover kept passing me jelly beans, so I was okay.  I kept looking around, though, at the other people in line. ""You smell anything?"" I murmured to Grover.  He took his nose out of the jelly-bean bag long enough to sniff. ""Underground,"" he said distastefully. ""Underground air always smells like monsters. Probably doesn't mean anything.""  But something felt wrong to me. I had a feeling we shouldn't be here.  ""Guys,"" I said. ""You know the gods' symbols of power?""  Annabeth had been in the middle of reading about the construction equipment used to build the Arch, but she looked over. ""Yeah?""  ""Well, Hade—""  Grover cleared his throat. ""We're in a public place.... You mean, our friend downstairs?""  ""Um, right,"" I said. ""Our friend way downstairs. Doesn't he have a hat like Annabeth's?""  ""You mean the Helm of Darkness,"" Annabeth said. ""Yeah, that's his symbol of power. I saw it next to his seat during the winter solstice council meeting.""  ""He was there?"" I asked.  She nodded. ""It's the only time he's allowed to visit Olympus—the darkest day of the year. But his helm is a lot more powerful than my invisibility hat, if what I've heard is true....""  ""It allows him to become darkness,"" Grover confirmed. ""He can melt into shadow or pass through walls. He can't be touched, or seen, or heard. And he can radiate fear so intense it can drive you insane or stop your heart. Why do you think all rational creatures fear the dark?""  ""But then ... how do we know he's not here right now, watching us?"" I asked.  Annabeth and Grover exchanged looks.  ""We don't,"" Grover said.  ""Thanks, that makes me feel a lot better,"" I said. ""Got any blue jelly beans left?""  I'd almost mastered my jumpy nerves when I saw the tiny little elevator car we were going to ride to the top of the Arch, and I knew I was in trouble. I hate confined places. They make me nuts.  We got shoehorned into the car with this big fat lady and her dog, a Chihuahua with a rhinestone collar. I figured maybe the dog was a seeing-eye Chihuahua, because none of the guards said a word about it.  We started going up, inside the Arch. I'd never been in an elevator that went in a curve, and my stomach wasn't too happy about it.  ""No parents?"" the fat lady asked us.  She had beady eyes; pointy, coffee-stained teeth; a floppy denim hat, and a denim dress that bulged so much, she looked like a blue-jean blimp.  ""They're below,"" Annabeth told her. ""Scared of heights.""  ""Oh, the poor darlings.""  The Chihuahua growled. The woman said, ""Now, now, sonny. Behave."" The dog had beady eyes like its owner, intelligent and vicious.  I said, ""Sonny. Is that his name?""  ""No,"" the lady told me.  She smiled, as if that cleared everything up.  At the top of the Arch, the observation deck reminded me of a tin can with carpeting. Rows of tiny windows looked out over the city on one side and the river on the other. The view was okay, but if there's anything I like less than a confined space, it's a confined space six hundred feet in the air. I was ready to go pretty quick.  Annabeth kept talking about structural supports, and how she would've made the windows bigger, and designed a see-through floor. She probably could've stayed up there for hours, but luckily for me the park ranger announced that the observation deck would be closing in a few minutes. I steered Grover and Annabeth toward the exit, loaded them into the elevator, and I was about to get in myself when I realized there were already two other tourists inside. No room for me.  The park ranger said, ""Next car, sir.""  ""We'll get out,"" Annabeth said. ""We'll wait with you.""  But that was going to mess everybody up and take even more time, so I said, ""Naw, it's okay. I'll see you guys at the bottom.""  Grover and Annabeth both looked nervous, but they let the elevator door slide shut. Their car disappeared down the ramp.  Now the only people left on the observation deck were me, a little boy with his parents, the park ranger, and the fat lady with her Chihuahua.  I smiled uneasily at the fat lady. She smiled back, her forked tongue flickering between her teeth.  Wait a minute.  Forked tongue?  Before I could decide if I'd really seen that, her Chihuahua jumped down and started yapping at me.  ""Now, now, sonny,"" the lady said. ""Does this look like a good time? We have all these nice people here.""  ""Doggie!"" said the little boy. ""Look, a doggie!""  His parents pulled him back.  The Chihuahua bared his teeth at me, foam dripping from his black lips.  ""Well, son,"" the fat lady sighed. ""If you insist.""  Ice started forming in my stomach. ""Urn, did you just call that Chihuahua your son?""  ""Chimera, dear,"" the fat lady corrected. ""Not a Chihuahua. It's an easy mistake to make.""  She rolled up her denim sleeves, revealing that the skin of her arms was scaly and green. When she smiled, I saw that her teeth were fangs. The pupils of her eyes were sideways slits, like a reptile's.  The Chihuahua barked louder, and with each bark, it grew. First to the size of a Doberman, then to a lion. The bark became a roar.  The little boy screamed. His parents pulled him back toward the exit, straight into the park ranger, who stood, paralyzed, gaping at the monster.  The Chimera was now so tall its back rubbed against the roof. It had the head of a lion with a blood-caked mane, the body and hooves of a giant goat, and a serpent for a tail, a ten-foot-long diamondback growing right out of its shaggy behind. The rhinestone dog collar still hung around its neck, and the plate-sized dog tag was now easy to read: CHIMERA—RABID, FIRE-BREATHING, POISONOUS—IF FOUND, PLEASE CALL TARTARUS—EXT. 954.  I realized I hadn't even uncapped my sword. My hands were numb. I was ten feet away from the Chimera's bloody maw, and I knew that as soon as I moved, the creature would lunge.  The snake lady made a hissing noise that might've been laughter. ""Be honored, Percy Jackson. Lord Zeus rarely allows me to test a hero with one of my brood. For I am the Mother of Monsters, the terrible Echidna!""  I stared at her. All I could think to say was: ""Isn't that a kind of anteater?""  She howled, her reptilian face turning brown and green with rage. ""I hate it when people say that! I hate Australia! Naming that ridiculous animal after me. For that, Percy Jackson, my son shall destroy you!""  The Chimera charged, its lion teeth gnashing. I managed to leap aside and dodge the bite.  I ended up next to the family and the park ranger, who were all screaming now, trying to pry open the emergency exit doors.  I couldn't let them get hurt. I uncapped my sword, ran to the other side of the deck, and yelled, ""Hey, Chihuahua!"" The Chimera turned faster than I would've thought possible.  Before I could swing my sword, it opened its mouth, emitting a stench like the world's largest barbecue pit, and shot a column of flame straight at me.  I dove through the explosion. The carpet burst into flames; the heat was so intense, it nearly seared off my eyebrows.  Where I had been standing a moment before was a ragged hole in the side of the Arch, with melted metal steaming around the edges.  Great, I thought. We just blowtorched a national monument.  Riptide was now a shining bronze blade in my hands, and as the Chimera turned, I slashed at its neck.  That was my fatal mistake. The blade sparked harmlessly off the dog collar. I tried to regain my balance, but I was so worried about defending myself against the fiery lion's mouth, I completely forgot about the serpent tail until it whipped around and sank its fangs into my calf.  My whole leg was on fire. I tried to jab Riptide into the Chimera's mouth, but the serpent tail wrapped around my ankles and pulled me off balance, and my blade flew out of my hand, spinning out of the hole in the Arch and down toward the Mississippi River.  I managed to get to my feet, but I knew I had lost. I was weaponless. I could feel deadly poison racing up to my chest. I remembered Chiron saying that Anaklusmos would always return to me, but there was no pen in my pocket. Maybe it had fallen too far away. Maybe it only returned when it was in pen form. I didn't know, and I wasn't going to live long enough to figure it out.  I backed into the hole in the wall. The Chimera advanced, growling, smoke curling from its lips. The snake lady, Echidna, cackled. ""They don't make heroes like they used to, eh, son?""  The monster growled. It seemed in no hurry to finish me off now that I was beaten.  I glanced at the park ranger and the family. The little boy was hiding behind his father's legs. I had to protect these people. I couldn't just ... die. I tried to think, but my whole body was on fire. My head felt dizzy. I had no sword. I was facing a massive, fire-breathing monster and its mother. And I was scared.  There was no place else to go, so I stepped to the edge of the hole. Far, far below, the river glittered.  If I died, would the monsters go away? Would they leave the humans alone?  ""If you are the son of Poseidon,"" Echidna hissed, ""you would not fear water. Jump, Percy Jackson. Show me that water will not harm you. Jump and retrieve your sword. Prove your bloodline.""  Yeah, right, I thought. I'd read somewhere that jumping into water from a couple of stories up was like jumping onto solid asphalt. From here, I'd splatter on impact.  The Chimera's mouth glowed red, heating up for another blast.  ""You have no faith,"" Echidna told me. ""You do not trust the gods. I cannot blame you, little coward. Better you die now. The gods are faithless. The poison is in your heart.""  She was right: I was dying. I could feel my breath slowing down. Nobody could save me, not even the gods.  I backed up and looked down at the water. I remembered the warm glow of my father's smile when I was a baby. He must have seen me. He must have visited me when I was in my cradle.  I remembered the swirling green trident that had appeared above my head the night of capture the flag, when Poseidon had claimed me as his son.  But this wasn't the sea. This was the Mississippi, dead center of the USA. There was no Sea God here.  ""Die, faithless one,"" Echidna rasped, and the Chimera sent a column of flame toward my face.  ""Father, help me,"" I prayed.  I turned and jumped. My clothes on fire, poison coursing through my veins, I plummeted toward the river."
Percy Jackson 1 Chapter 14,"I'd love to tell you I had some deep revelation on my way down, that I came to terms with my own mortality, laughed in the face of death, et cetera.  The truth? My only thought was: Aaaaggghhhhh!  The river raced toward me at the speed of a truck. Wind ripped the breath from my lungs. Steeples and skyscrapers and bridges tumbled in and out of my vision.  And then: Flaaa-boooom!  A whiteout of bubbles. I sank through the murk, sure that I was about to end up embedded in a hundred feet of mud and lost forever.  But my impact with the water hadn't hurt. I was falling slowly now, bubbles trickling up through my fingers. I settled on the river bottom soundlessly. A catfish the size of my stepfather lurched away into the gloom. Clouds of silt and disgusting garbage—beer bottles, old shoes, plastic bags—swirled up all around me.  At that point, I realized a few things: first, I had not been flattened into a pancake. I had not been barbecued. I couldn't even feel the Chimera poison boiling in my veins anymore. I was alive, which was good.  Second realization: I wasn't wet. I mean, I could feel the coolness of the water. I could see where the fire on my clothes had been quenched. But when I touched my own shirt, it felt perfectly dry.  I looked at the garbage floating by and snatched an old cigarette lighter.  No way, I thought.  I flicked the lighter. It sparked. A tiny flame appeared, right there at the bottom of the Mississippi.  I grabbed a soggy hamburger wrapper out of the current and immediately the paper turned dry. I lit it with no problem. As soon as I let it go, the flames sputtered out. The wrapper turned back into a slimy rag. Weird.  But the strangest thought occurred to me only last: I was breathing. I was underwater, and I was breathing normally.  I stood up, thigh-deep in mud. My legs felt shaky. My hands trembled. I should've been dead. The fact that I wasn't seemed like ... well, a miracle. I imagined a woman's voice, a voice that sounded a bit like my mother: Percy, what do you say?  ""Um ... thanks."" Underwater, I sounded like I did on recordings, like a much older kid. ""Thank you ... Father.""  No response. Just the dark drift of garbage downriver, the enormous catfish gliding by, the flash of sunset on the water's surface far above, turning everything the color of butterscotch.  Why had Poseidon saved me? The more I thought about it, the more ashamed I felt. So I'd gotten lucky a few times before. Against a thing like the Chimera, I had never stood a chance. Those poor people in the Arch were probably toast. I couldn't protect them. I was no hero. Maybe I should just stay down here with the catfish, join the bottom feeders.  Fump-fump-fump. A riverboat's paddlewheel churned above me, swirling the silt around.  There, not five feet in front of me, was my sword, its gleaming bronze hilt sticking up in the mud.  I heard that woman's voice again: Percy, take the sword. Your father believes in you. This time, I knew the voice wasn't in my head. I wasn't imagining it. Her words seemed to come from everywhere, rippling through the water like dolphin sonar.  ""Where are you?"" I called aloud.  Then, through the gloom, I saw her—a woman the color of the water, a ghost in the current, floating just above the sword. She had long billowing hair, and her eyes, barely visible, were green like mine.  A lump formed in my throat. I said, ""Mom?""  No, child, only a messenger, though your mother's fate is not as hopeless as you believe. Go to the beach in Santa Monica.  ""What?""  It is your father's will. Before you descend into the Underworld, you must go to Santa Monica. Please, Percy, I cannot stay long. The river here is too foul for my presence.  ""But ..."" I was sure this woman was my mother, or a vision of her, anyway. ""Who—how did you—""  There was so much I wanted to ask, the words jammed up in my throat.  I cannot stay, brave one, the woman said. She reached out, and I felt the current brush my face like a caress. You must go to Santa Monica! And, Percy, do not trust the gifts....  Her voice faded.  ""Gifts?"" I asked. ""What gifts? Wait!""  She made one more attempt to speak, but the sound was gone. Her image melted away. If it was my mother, I had lost her again.  I felt like drowning myself. The only problem: I was immune to drowning. Your father believes in you, she had said.  She'd also called me brave ... unless she was talking to the catfish.  I waded toward Riptide and grabbed it by the hilt. The Chimera might still be up there with its snaky, fat mother, waiting to finish me off. At the very least, the mortal police would be arriving, trying to figure out who had blown a hole in the Arch. If they found me, they'd have some questions.  I capped my sword, stuck the ballpoint pen in my pocket. ""Thank you, Father,"" I said again to the dark water.  Then I kicked up through the muck and swam for the surface.  I came ashore next to a floating McDonald's.  A block away, every emergency vehicle in St. Louis was surrounding the Arch. Police helicopters circled overhead. The crowd of onlookers reminded me of Times Square on New Year's Eve.  A little girl said, ""Mama! That boy walked out of the river.""  ""That's nice, dear,"" her mother said, craning her neck to watch the ambulances.  ""But he's dry!""  ""That's nice, dear.""  A news lady was talking for the camera: ""Probably not a terrorist attack, we're told, but it's still very early in the investigation. The damage, as you can see, is very serious. We're trying to get to some of the survivors, to question them about eyewitness reports of someone falling from the Arch.""  Survivors. I felt a surge of relief. Maybe the park ranger and that family made it out safely. I hoped Annabeth and Grover were okay.  I tried to push through the crowd to see what was going on inside the police line.  ""... an adolescent boy,"" another reporter was saying. ""Channel Five has learned that surveillance cameras show an adolescent boy going wild on the observation deck, somehow setting off this freak explosion. Hard to believe, John, but that's what we're hearing. Again, no confirmed fatalities ...""  I backed away, trying to keep my head down. I had to go a long way around the police perimeter. Uniformed officers and news reporters were everywhere.  I'd almost lost hope of ever finding Annabeth and Grover when a familiar voice bleated, ""Perrr-cy!""  I turned and got tackled by Grover's bear hug—or goat hug. He said, ""We thought you'd gone to Hades the hard way!""  Annabeth stood behind him, trying to look angry, but even she seemed relieved to see me. ""We can't leave you alone for five minutes! What happened?""  ""I sort of fell.""  ""Percy! Six hundred and thirty feet?""  Behind us, a cop shouted, ""Gangway!"" The crowd parted, and a couple of paramedics hustled out, rolling a woman on a stretcher. I recognized her immediately as the mother of the little boy who'd been on the observation deck. She was saying, ""And then this huge dog, this huge fire-breathing Chihuahua—""  ""Okay, ma'am,"" the paramedic said. ""Just calm down. Your family is fine. The medication is starting to kick in.""  ""I'm not crazy! This boy jumped out of the hole and the monster disappeared."" Then she saw me. ""There he is! That's the boy!""  I turned quickly and pulled Annabeth and Grover after me. We disappeared into the crowd.  ""What's going on?"" Annabeth demanded. ""Was she talking about the Chihuahua on the elevator?""  I told them the whole story of the Chimera, Echidna, my high-dive act, and the underwater lady's message.  ""Whoa,"" said Grover. ""We've got to get you to Santa Monica! You can't ignore a summons from your dad.""  Before Annabeth could respond, we passed another reporter doing a news break, and I almost froze in my tracks when he said, ""Percy Jackson. That's right, Dan. Channel Twelve has learned that the boy who may have caused this explosion fits the description of a young man wanted by authorities for a serious New Jersey bus accident three days ago. And the boy is believed to be traveling west. For our viewers at home, here is a photo of Percy Jackson.""  We ducked around the news van and slipped into an alley.  ""First things first,"" I told Grover. ""We've got to get out of town!""  Somehow, we made it back to the Amtrak station without getting spotted. We got on board the train just before it pulled out for Denver. The train trundled west as darkness fell, police lights still pulsing against the St. Louis skyline behind us."
Percy Jackson 1 Chapter 15,"The next afternoon, June 14, seven days before the solstice, our train rolled into Denver. We hadn't eaten since the night before in the dining car, somewhere in Kansas. We hadn't taken a shower since Half-Blood Hill, and I was sure that was obvious.  ""Let's try to contact Chiron,"" Annabeth said. ""I want to tell him about your talk with the river spirit.""  ""We can't use phones, right?""  ""I'm not talking about phones.""  We wandered through downtown for about half an hour, though I wasn't sure what Annabeth was looking for. The air was dry and hot, which felt weird after the humidity of St. Louis. Everywhere we turned, the Rocky Mountains seemed to be staring at me, like a tidal wave about to crash into the city.  Finally we found an empty do-it-yourself car wash. We veered toward the stall farthest from the street, keeping our eyes open for patrol cars. We were three adolescents hanging out at a car wash without a car; any cop worth his doughnuts would figure we were up to no good.  ""What exactly are we doing?"" I asked, as Grover took out the spray gun.  ""It's seventy-five cents,"" he grumbled. ""I've only got two quarters left. Annabeth?""  ""Don't look at me,"" she said. ""The dining car wiped me out.""  I fished out my last bit of change and passed Grover a quarter, which left me two nickels and one drachma from Medusa's place.  ""Excellent,"" Grover said. ""We could do it with a spray bottle, of course, but the connection isn't as good, and my arm gets tired of pumping.""  ""What are you talking about?""  He fed in the quarters and set the knob to FINE MIST. ""I-M'ing.""  ""Instant messaging?""  ""Iris-messaging,"" Annabeth corrected. ""The rainbow goddess Iris carries messages for the gods. If you know how to ask, and she's not too busy, she'll do the same for half-bloods.""  ""You summon the goddess with a spray gun?""  Grover pointed the nozzle in the air and water hissed out in a thick white mist. ""Unless you know an easier way to make a rainbow.""  Sure enough, late afternoon light filtered through the vapor and broke into colors.  Annabeth held her palm out to me. ""Drachma, please.""  I handed it over.  She raised the coin over her head. ""O goddess, accept our offering.""  She threw the drachma into the rainbow. It disappeared in a golden shimmer.  ""Half-Blood Hill,"" Annabeth requested.  For a moment, nothing happened.  Then I was looking through the mist at strawberry fields, and the Long Island Sound in the distance. We seemed to be on the porch of the Big House. Standing with his back to us at the railing was a sandy-haired guy in shorts and an orange tank top. He was holding a bronze sword and seemed to be staring intently at something down in the meadow.  ""Luke!"" I called.  He turned, eyes wide. I could swear he was standing three feet in front of me through a screen of mist, except I could only see the part of him that appeared in the rainbow.  ""Percy!"" His scarred face broke into a grin. ""Is that Annabeth, too? Thank the gods! Are you guys okay?""  ""We're ... uh ... fine,"" Annabeth stammered. She was madly straightening her dirty T-shirt, trying to comb the loose hair out of her face. ""We thought—Chiron—I mean—""  ""He's down at the cabins."" Luke's smile faded. ""We're having some issues with the campers. Listen, is everything cool with you? Is Grover all right?""  ""I'm right here,"" Grover called. He held the nozzle out to one side and stepped into Luke's line of vision. ""What kind of issues?""  Just then a big Lincoln Continental pulled into the car wash with its stereo turned to maximum hip-hop. As the car slid into the next stall, the bass from the subwoofers vibrated so much, it shook the pavement.  ""Chiron had to—what's that noise?"" Luke yelled.  ""I'll take care of it.'"" Annabeth yelled back, looking very relieved to have an excuse to get out of sight. ""Grover, come on!  ""What?"" Grover said. ""But—""  ""Give Percy the nozzle and come on!"" she ordered.  Grover muttered something about girls being harder to understand than the Oracle at Delphi, then he handed me the spray gun and followed Annabeth.  I readjusted the hose so I could keep the rainbow going and still see Luke.  ""Chiron had to break up a fight,"" Luke shouted to me over the music. ""Things are pretty tense here, Percy. Word leaked out about the Zeus—Poseidon standoff. We're still not sure how—probably the same scumbag who summoned the hellhound. Now the campers are starting to take sides. It's shaping up like the Trojan War all over again. Aphrodite, Ares, and Apollo are backing Poseidon, more or less. Athena is backing Zeus.""  I shuddered to think that Clarisse's cabin would ever be on my dad's side for anything. In the next stall, I heard Annabeth and some guy arguing with each other, then the music's volume decreased drastically.  ""So what's your status?"" Luke asked me. ""Chiron will be sorry he missed you.""  I told him pretty much everything, including my dreams. It felt so good to see him, to feel like I was back at camp even for a few minutes, that I didn't realize how long I had talked until the beeper went off on the spray machine, and I realized I only had one more minute before the water shut off.  ""I wish I could be there,"" Luke told me. ""We can't help much from here, I'm afraid, but listen ... it had to be Hades who took the master bolt. He was there at Olympus at the winter solstice. I was chaperoning a field trip and we saw him.""  ""But Chiron said the gods can't take each other's magic items directly.""  ""That's true,"" Luke said, looking troubled. ""Still ... Hades has the helm of darkness. How could anybody else sneak into the throne room and steal the master bolt? You'd have to be invisible.""  We were both silent, until Luke seemed to realize what he'd said.  ""Oh, hey,"" he protested. ""I didn't mean Annabeth. She and I have known each other forever. She would never ... I mean, she's like a little sister to me.""  I wondered if Annabeth would like that description. In the stall next to us, the music stopped completely. A man screamed in terror, car doors slammed, and the Lincoln peeled out of the car wash.  ""You'd better go see what that was,"" Luke said. ""Listen, are you wearing the flying shoes? I'll feel better if I know they've done you some good.""  ""Oh ... uh, yeah!"" I tried not to sound like a guilty liar. ""Yeah, they've come in handy.""  ""Really?"" He grinned. ""They fit and everything?""  The water shut off. The mist started to evaporate.  ""Well, take care of yourself out there in Denver,"" Luke called, his voice getting fainter. ""And tell Grover it'll be better this time! Nobody will get turned into a pine tree if he just—""  But the mist was gone, and Luke's image faded to nothing. I was alone in a wet, empty car wash stall. Annabeth and Grover came around the corner, laughing, but stopped when they saw my face. Annabeth's smile faded. ""What happened, Percy? What did Luke say?""  ""Not much,"" I lied, my stomach feeling as empty as a Big Three cabin. ""Come on, let's find some dinner.""  A few minutes later, we were sitting at a booth in a gleaming chrome diner. All around us, families were eating burgers and drinking malts and sodas.  Finally the waitress came over. She raised her eyebrow skeptically. ""Well?""  I said, ""We, um, want to order dinner.""  ""You kids have money to pay for it?""  Grover's lower lip quivered. I was afraid he would start bleating, or worse, start eating the linoleum. Annabeth looked ready to pass out from hunger.  I was trying to think up a sob story for the waitress when a rumble shook the whole building; a motorcycle the size of a baby elephant had pulled up to the curb.  All conversation in the diner stopped. The motorcycle's headlight glared red. Its gas tank had flames painted on it, and a shotgun holster riveted to either side, complete with shotguns. The seat was leather—but leather that looked like ... well, Caucasian human skin.  The guy on the bike would've made pro wrestlers run for Mama. He was dressed in a red muscle shirt and black jeans and a black leather duster, with a hunting knife strapped to his thigh. He wore red wraparound shades, and he had the cruelest, most brutal face I'd ever seen— handsome, I guess, but wicked—with an oily black crew cut and cheeks that were scarred from many, many fights. The weird thing was, I felt like I'd seen his face somewhere before.  As he walked into the diner, a hot, dry wind blew through the place. All the people rose, as if they were hypnotized, but the biker waved his hand dismissively and they all sat down again. Everybody went back to their conversations. The waitress blinked, as if somebody had just pressed the rewind button on her brain. She asked us again, ""You kids have money to pay for it?""  The biker said, ""It's on me."" He slid into our booth, which was way too small for him, and crowded Annabeth against the window.  He looked up at the waitress, who was gaping at him, and said, ""Are you still here?""  He pointed at her, and she stiffened. She turned as if she'd been spun around, then marched back toward the kitchen.  The biker looked at me. I couldn't see his eyes behind the red shades, but bad feelings started boiling in my stomach. Anger, resentment, bitterness. I wanted to hit a wall. I wanted to pick a fight with somebody. Who did this guy think he was?  He gave me a wicked grin. ""So you're old Seaweed's kid, huh?""  I should've been surprised, or scared, but instead I felt like I was looking at my stepdad, Gabe. I wanted to rip this guy's head off. ""What's it to you?""  Annabeth's eyes flashed me a warning. ""Percy, this is—""  The biker raised his hand.  ""S'okay,"" he said. ""I don't mind a little attitude. Long as you remember who's the boss. You know who I am, little cousin?""  Then it struck me why this guy looked familiar. He had the same vicious sneer as some of the kids at CampHalf-Blood, the ones from cabin five.  ""You're Clarisse's dad,"" I said. ""Ares, god of war.""  Ares grinned and took off his shades. Where his eyes should've been, there was only fire, empty sockets glowing with miniature nuclear explosions. ""That's right, punk. I heard you broke Clarisse's spear.""  ""She was asking for it.""  ""Probably. That's cool. I don't fight my kids' fights, you know? What I'm here for—I heard you were in town. I got a little proposition for you.""  The waitress came back with heaping trays of food—cheeseburgers, fries, onion rings, and chocolate shakes.  Ares handed her a few gold drachmas.  She looked nervously at the coins. ""But, these aren't...""  Ares pulled out his huge knife and started cleaning his fingernails. ""Problem, sweetheart?""  The waitress swallowed, then left with the gold.  ""You can't do that,"" I told Ares. ""You can't just threaten people with a knife.""  Ares laughed. ""Are you kidding? I love this country. Best place since Sparta. Don't you carry a weapon, punk? You should. Dangerous world out there. Which brings me to my proposition. I need you to do me a favor.""  ""What favor could I do for a god?""  ""Something a god doesn't have time to do himself. It's nothing much. I left my shield at an abandoned water park here in town. I was going on a little ... date with my girlfriend. We were interrupted. I left my shield behind. I want you to fetch it for me.""  ""Why don't you go back and get it yourself?""  The fire in his eye sockets glowed a little hotter.  ""Why don't I turn you into a prairie dog and run you over with my Harley? Because I don't feel like it. A god is giving you an opportunity to prove yourself, Percy Jackson. Will you prove yourself a coward?"" He leaned forward. ""Or maybe you only fight when there's a river to dive into, so your daddy can protect you.""  I wanted to punch this guy, but somehow, I knew he was waiting for that. Ares's power was causing my anger. He'd love it if I attacked. I didn't want to give him the satisfaction.  ""We're not interested,"" I said. ""We've already got a quest.""  Ares's fiery eyes made me see things I didn't want to see—blood and smoke and corpses on the battlefield. ""I know all about your quest, punk. When that item was first stolen, Zeus sent his best out looking for it: Apollo, Athena, Artemis, and me, naturally. If I couldn't sniff out a weapon that powerful ..."" He licked his lips, as if the very thought of the master bolt made him hungry. ""Well ... if I couldn't find it, you got no hope. Nevertheless, I'm trying to give you the benefit of the doubt. Your dad and I go way back. After all, I'm the one who told him my suspicions about old Corpse Breath.""  ""You told him Hades stole the bolt?""  ""Sure. Framing somebody to start a war. Oldest trick in the book. I recognized it immediately. In a way, you got me to thank for your little quest.""  ""Thanks,"" I grumbled.  ""Hey, I'm a generous guy. Just do my little job, and I'll help you on your way. I'll arrange a ride west for you and your friends.""  ""We're doing fine on our own.""  ""Yeah, right. No money. No wheels. No clue what you're up against. Help me out, and maybe I'll tell you something you need to know. Something about your mom.""  ""My mom?""  He grinned. ""That got your attention. The water park is a mile west on Delancy. You can't miss it. Look for the Tunnel of Love ride.""  ""What interrupted your date?"" I asked. ""Something scare you off?""  Ares bared his teeth, but I'd seen his threatening look before on Clarisse. There was something false about it, almost like he was nervous.  ""You're lucky you met me, punk, and not one of the other Olympians. They're not as forgiving of rudeness as I am. I'll meet you back here when you're done. Don't disappoint me.""  After that I must have fainted, or fallen into a trance, because when I opened my eyes again, Ares was gone. I might've thought the conversation had been a dream, but Annabeth and Grover's expressions told me otherwise.  ""Not good,"" Grover said. ""Ares sought you out, Percy. This is not good.""  I stared out the window. The motorcycle had disappeared.  Did Ares really know something about my mom, or was he just playing with me? Now that he was gone, all the anger had drained out of me. I realized Ares must love to mess with people's emotions. That was his power—cranking up the passions so badly, they clouded your ability to think.  ""It's probably some kind of trick,"" I said. ""Forget Ares. Let's just go.""  ""We can't,"" Annabeth said. ""Look, I hate Ares as much as anybody, but you don't ignore the gods unless you want serious bad fortune. He wasn't kidding about turning you into a rodent.""  I looked down at my cheeseburger, which suddenly didn't seem so appetizing. ""Why does he need us?""  ""Maybe it's a problem that requires brains,"" Annabeth said. ""Ares has strength. That's all he has. Even strength has to bow to wisdom sometimes.""  ""But this water park ... he acted almost scared. What would make a war god run away like that?""  Annabeth and Grover glanced nervously at each other.  Annabeth said, ""I'm afraid we'll have to find out.""  The sun was sinking behind the mountains by the time we found the water park. Judging from the sign, it once had been called WATERLAND, but now some of the letters were smashed out, so it read WAT R A D.  The main gate was padlocked and topped with barbed wire. Inside, huge dry waterslides and tubes and pipes curled everywhere, leading to empty pools. Old tickets and advertisements fluttered around the asphalt. With night coming on, the place looked sad and creepy.  ""If Ares brings his girlfriend here for a date,"" I said, staring up at the barbed wire, ""I'd hate to see what she looks like.""  ""Percy,"" Annabeth warned. ""Be more respectful.""  ""Why? I thought you hated Ares.""  ""He's still a god. And his girlfriend is very temperamental.""  ""You don't want to insult her looks,"" Grover added.  ""Who is she? Echidna?""  ""No, Aphrodite,"" Grover said, a little dreamily. ""Goddess of love.""  ""I thought she was married to somebody,"" I said. ""Hephaestus.""  ""What's your point?"" he asked.  ""Oh."" I suddenly felt the need to change the subject. ""So how do we get in?""  ""Maia!"" Grover's shoes sprouted wings.  He flew over the fence, did an unintended somersault in midair, then stumbled to a landing on the opposite side. He dusted off his jeans, as if he'd planned the whole thing. ""You guys coming?""  Annabeth and I had to climb the old-fashioned way, holding down the barbed wire for each other as we crawled over the top.  The shadows grew long as we walked through the park, checking out the attractions. There was AnkleBiterIsland, Head Over Wedgie, and Dude, Where's My Swimsuit?  No monsters came to get us. Nothing made the slightest noise.  We found a souvenir shop that had been left open. Merchandise still lined the shelves: snow globes, pencils, postcards, and racks of—  ""Clothes,"" Annabeth said. ""Fresh clothes.""  ""Yeah,"" I said. ""But you can't just—""  ""Watch me.""  She snatched an entire row of stuff of the racks and disappeared into the changing room. A few minutes later she came out in Waterland flower-print shorts, a big red Waterland T-shirt, and commemorative Waterland surf shoes. A Waterland backpack was slung over her shoulder, obviously stuffed with more goodies.  ""What the heck."" Grover shrugged. Soon, all three of us were decked out like walking advertisements for the defunct theme park.  We continued searching for the Tunnel of Love. I got the feeling that the whole park was holding its breath. ""So Ares and Aphrodite,"" I said, to keep my mind off the growing dark, ""they have a thing going?""  ""That's old gossip, Percy,"" Annabeth told me. ""Three-thousand-year-old gossip."" ""What about Aphrodite's husband?""  ""Well, you know,"" she said. ""Hephaestus. The blacksmith. He was crippled when he was a baby, thrown off MountOlympus by Zeus. So he isn't exactly handsome. Clever with his hands, and all, but Aphrodite isn't into brains and talent, you know?""  ""She likes bikers.""  ""Whatever.""  ""Hephaestus knows?""  ""Oh sure,"" Annabeth said. ""He caught them together once. I mean, literally caught them, in a golden net, and invited all the gods to come and laugh at them. Hephaestus is always trying to embarrass them. That's why they meet in out-of-the-way places, like ...""  She stopped, looking straight ahead. ""Like that.""  In front of us was an empty pool that would've been awesome for skateboarding. It was at least fifty yards across and shaped like a bowl.  Around the rim, a dozen bronze statues of Cupid stood guard with wings spread and bows ready to fire. On the opposite side from us, a tunnel opened up, probably where the water flowed into when the pool was full. The sign above it read, THRILL RIDE O' LOVE: THIS IS NOT YOUR PARENTS' TUNNEL OF LOVE!  Grover crept toward the edge. ""Guys, look.""  Marooned at the bottom of the pool was a pink-and-white two-seater boat with a canopy over the top and little hearts painted all over it. In the left seat, glinting in the fading light, was Ares's shield, a polished circle of bronze.  ""This is too easy,"" I said. ""So we just walk down there and get it?""  Annabeth ran her fingers along the base of the nearest Cupid statue.  ""There's a Greek letter carved here,"" she said. ""Eta. I wonder ...""  ""Grover,"" I said, ""you smell any monsters?""  He sniffed the wind. ""Nothing.""  ""Nothing—like, in-the-Arch-and-you-didn't-smell-Echidna nothing, or really nothing?""  Grover looked hurt. ""I told you, that was underground.""  ""Okay, I'm sorry."" I took a deep breath. ""I'm going down there.""  ""I'll go with you."" Grover didn't sound too enthusiastic, but I got the feeling he was trying to make up for what had happened in St. Louis.  ""No,"" I told him. ""I want you to stay up top with the flying shoes. You're the Red Baron, a flying ace, remember? I'll be counting on you for backup, in case something goes wrong.""  Grover puffed up his chest a little. ""Sure. But what could go wrong?""  ""I don't know. Just a feeling. Annabeth, come with me—""  ""Are you kidding?"" She looked at me as if I'd just dropped from the moon. Her cheeks were bright red.  ""What's the problem now?"" I demanded.  ""Me, go with you to the ... the 'Thrill Ride of Love'? How embarrassing is that? What if somebody saw me?""  ""Who's going to see you?"" But my face was burning now, too. Leave it to a girl to make everything complicated. ""Fine,"" I told her. ""I'll do it myself."" But when I started down the side of the pool, she followed me, muttering about how boys always messed things up.  We reached the boat. The shield was propped on one seat, and next to it was a lady's silk scarf. I tried to imagine Ares and Aphrodite here, a couple of gods meeting in a junked-out amusement-park ride. Why? Then I noticed something I hadn't seen from up top: mirrors all the way around the rim of the pool, facing this spot. We could see ourselves no matter which direction we looked. That must be it. While Ares and Aphrodite were smooching with each other they could look at their favorite people: themselves.  I picked up the scarf. It shimmered pink, and the perfume was indescribable—rose, or mountain laurel. Something good. I smiled, a little dreamy, and was about to rub the scarf against my cheek when Annabeth ripped it out of my hand and stuffed it in her pocket. ""Oh, no you don't. Stay away from that love magic.""  ""What?""  ""Just get the shield, Seaweed Brain, and let's get out of here.""  The moment I touched the shield, I knew we were in trouble. My hand broke through something that had been connecting it to the dashboard. A cobweb, I thought, but then I looked at a strand of it on my palm and saw it was some kind of metal filament, so fine it was almost invisible. A trip wire.  ""Wait,"" Annabeth said.  ""Too late.""  ""There's another Greek letter on the side of the boat, another Eta. This is a trap.""  Noise erupted all around us, of a million gears grinding, as if the whole pool were turning into one giant machine.  Grover yelled, ""Guys!""  Up on the rim, the Cupid statues were drawing their bows into firing position. Before I could suggest taking cover, they shot, but not at us. They fired at each other, across the rim of the pool. Silky cables trailed from the arrows, arcing over the pool and anchoring where they landed to form a huge golden asterisk. Then smaller metallic threads started weaving together magically between the main strands, making a net.  ""We have to get out,"" I said.  ""Duh!"" Annabeth said.  I grabbed the shield and we ran, but going up the slope of the pool was not as easy as going down.  ""Come on!"" Grover shouted.  He was trying to hold open a section of the net for us, but wherever he touched it, the golden threads started to wrap around his hands.  The Cupids' heads popped open. Out came video cameras. Spotlights rose up all around the pool, blinding us with illumination, and a loudspeaker voice boomed: ""Live to Olympus in one minute ... Fifty-nine seconds, fifty-eight ...""  ""Hephaestus!"" Annabeth screamed. ""I'm so stupid.' Eta is H.' He made this trap to catch his wife with Ares. Now we're going to be broadcast live to Olympus and look like absolute fools!""  We'd almost made it to the rim when the row of mirrors opened like hatches and thousands of tiny metallic ... things poured out.  Annabeth screamed.  It was an army of wind-up creepy-crawlies: bronze-gear bodies, spindly legs, little pincer mouths, all scuttling toward us in a wave of clacking, whirring metal.  ""Spiders!"" Annabeth said. ""Sp—sp—aaaah!""  I'd never seen her like this before. She fell backward in terror and almost got overwhelmed by the spider robots before I pulled her up and dragged her back toward the boat.  The things were coming out from all around the rim now, millions of them, flooding toward the center of the pool, completely surrounding us. I told myself they probably weren't programmed to kill, just corral us and bite us and make us look stupid. Then again, this was a trap meant for gods. And we weren't gods.  Annabeth and I climbed into the boat. I started kicking away the spiders as they swarmed aboard.  I yelled at Annabeth to help me, but she was too paralyzed to do much more than scream.  ""Thirty, twenty-nine,"" called the loudspeaker.  The spiders started spitting out strands of metal thread, trying to tie us down. The strands were easy enough to break at first, but there were so many of them, and the spiders just kept coming. I kicked one away from Annabeth's leg and its pincers took a chunk out of my new surf shoe.  Grover hovered above the pool in his flying sneakers, trying to pull the net loose, but it wouldn't budge.  Think, I told myself. Think.  The Tunnel of Love entrance was under the net. We could use it as an exit, except that it was blocked by a million robot spiders.  ""Fifteen, fourteen,"" the loudspeaker called.  Water, I thought. Where does the ride's water come from?  Then I saw them: huge water pipes behind the mirrors, where the spiders had come from. And up above the net, next to one of the Cupids, a glass-windowed booth that must be the controller's station.  ""Grover!"" I yelled. ""Get into that booth! Find the 'on' switch!""  ""But—""  ""Do it!"" It was a crazy hope, but it was our only chance. The spiders were all over the prow of the boat now. Annabeth was screaming her head off. I had to get us out of there.  Grover was in the controller's booth now, slamming away at the buttons.  ""Five, four—""  Grover looked up at me hopelessly, raising his hands. He was letting me know that he'd pushed every button, but still nothing was happening.  I closed my eyes and thought about waves, rushing water, the Mississippi River. I felt a familiar tug in my gut. I tried to imagine that I was dragging the ocean all the way to Denver.  ""Two, one, zero!""  Water exploded out of the pipes. It roared into the pool, sweeping away the spiders. I pulled Annabeth into the seat next to me and fastened her seat belt just as the tidal wave slammed into our boat, over the top, whisking the spiders away and dousing us completely, but not capsizing us. The boat turned, lifted in the flood, and spun in circles around the whirlpool.  The water was full of short-circuiting spiders, some of them smashing against the pool's concrete wall with such force they burst.  Spotlights glared down at us. The Cupid-cams were rolling, live to Olympus.  But I could only concentrate on controlling the boat. I willed it to ride the current, to keep away from the wall. Maybe it was my imagination, but the boat seemed to respond. At least, it didn't break into a million pieces. We spun around one last time, the water level now almost high enough to shred us against the metal net. Then the boat's nose turned toward the tunnel and we rocketed through into the darkness.  Annabeth and I held tight, both of us screaming as the boat shot curls and hugged corners and took forty-five-degree plunges past pictures of Romeo and Juliet and a bunch of other Valentine's Day stuff.  Then we were out of the tunnel, the night air whistling through our hair as the boat barreled straight toward the exit.  If the ride had been in working order, we would've sailed off a ramp between the golden Gates of Love and splashed down safely in the exit pool. But there was a problem. The Gates of Love were chained. Two boats that had been washed out of the tunnel before us were now piled against the barricade—one submerged, the other cracked in half.  ""Unfasten your seat belt,"" I yelled to Annabeth.  ""Are you crazy?""  ""Unless you want to get smashed to death."" I strapped Ares's shield to my arm. ""We're going to have to jump for it."" My idea was simple and insane. As the boat struck, we would use its force like a springboard to jump the gate. I'd heard of people surviving car crashes that way, getting thrown thirty or forty feet away from an accident. With luck, we would land in the pool.  Annabeth seemed to understand. She gripped my hand as the gates got closer.  ""On my mark,"" I said.  ""No! On my mark!""  ""What?""  ""Simple physics!"" she yelled. ""Force times the trajectory angle—""  ""Fine.'"" I shouted. ""On your mark!""  She hesitated ... hesitated ... then yelled, ""Now!""  Crack!  Annabeth was right. If we'd jumped when I thought we should've, we would've crashed into the gates. She got us maximum lift.  Unfortunately, that was a little more than we needed. Our boat smashed into the pileup and we were thrown into the air, straight over the gates, over the pool, and down toward solid asphalt.  Something grabbed me from behind.  Annabeth yelled, ""Ouch!""  Grover!  In midair, he had grabbed me by the shirt, and Annabeth by the arm, and was trying to pull us out of a crash landing, but Annabeth and I had all the momentum. ""You're too heavy!"" Grover said. ""We're going down!""  We spiraled toward the ground, Grover doing his best to slow the fall.  We smashed into a photo-board, Grover's head going straight into the hole where tourists would put their faces, pretending to be Noo-Noo the Friendly Whale. Annabeth and I tumbled to the ground, banged up but alive. Ares's shield was still on my arm.  Once we caught our breath, Annabeth and I got Grover out of the photo-board and thanked him for saving our lives. I looked back at the Thrill Ride of Love. The water was subsiding. Our boat had been smashed to pieces against the gates.  A hundred yards away, at the entrance pool, the Cupids were still filming. The statues had swiveled so that their cameras were trained straight on us, the spotlights in our faces.  ""Show's over!"" I yelled. ""Thank you! Good night!""  The Cupids turned back to their original positions. The lights shut off. The park went quiet and dark again, except for the gentle trickle of water into the Thrill Ride of Love's exit pool. I wondered if Olympus had gone to a commercial break, or if our ratings had been any good.  I hated being teased. I hated being tricked. And I had plenty of experience handling bullies who liked to do that stuff to me. I hefted the shield on my arm and turned to my friends. ""We need to have a little talk with Ares."""
Percy Jackson 1 Chapter 16,"The war god was waiting for us in the diner parking lot.  ""Well, well,"" he said. ""You didn't get yourself killed.""  ""You knew it was a trap,"" I said.  Ares gave me a wicked grin. ""Bet that crippled blacksmith was surprised when he netted a couple of stupid kids. You looked good on TV.""  I shoved his shield at him. ""You're a jerk.""  Annabeth and Grover caught their breath.  Ares grabbed the shield and spun it in the air like pizza dough. It changed form, melting into a bulletproof vest. He slung it across his back.  ""See that truck over there?"" He pointed to an eighteen-wheeler parked across the street from the diner. ""That's your ride. Take you straight to L.A., with one stop in Vegas.""  The eighteen-wheeler had a sign on the back, which I could read only because it was reverse-printed white on black, a good combination for dyslexia: KINDNESS INTERNATIONAL: HUMANE ZOO TRANSPORT. WARNING: LIVE WILD ANIMALS.  I said, ""You're kidding.""  Ares snapped his fingers. The back door of the truck unlatched. ""Free ride west, punk. Stop complaining. And here's a little something for doing the job.""  He slung a blue nylon backpack off his handlebars and tossed it to me.  Inside were fresh clothes for all of us, twenty bucks in cash, a pouch full of golden drachmas, and a bag of Double Stuf Oreos.  I said, ""I don't want your lousy—""  ""Thank you, Lord Ares,"" Grover interrupted, giving me his best red-alert warning look. ""Thanks a lot.""  I gritted my teeth. It was probably a deadly insult to refuse something from a god, but I didn't want anything that Ares had touched. Reluctantly, I slung the backpack over my shoulder. I knew my anger was being caused by the war god's presence, but I was still itching to punch him in the nose. He reminded me of every bully I'd ever faced: Nancy Bobofit, Clarisse, Smelly Gabe, sarcastic teachers—every jerk who'd called me stupid in school or laughed at me when I'd gotten expelled.  I looked back at the diner, which had only a couple of customers now. The waitress who'd served us dinner was watching nervously out the window, like she was afraid Ares might hurt us. She dragged the fry cook out from the kitchen to see. She said something to him. He nodded, held up a little disposable camera and snapped a picture of us.  Great, I thought. We'll make the papers again tomorrow.  I imagined the headline: TWELVE-YEAR-OLD OUTLAW BEATS UP DEFENSELESS BIKER.  ""You owe me one more thing,"" I told Ares, trying to keep my voice level. ""You promised me information about my mother.""  ""You sure you can handle the news?"" He kick-started his motorcycle. ""She's not dead.""  The ground seemed to spin beneath me. ""What do you mean?""  ""I mean she was taken away from the Minotaur before she could die. She was turned into a shower of gold, right? That's metamorphosis. Not death. She's being kept.""  ""Kept. Why?""  ""You need to study war, punk. Hostages. You take somebody to control somebody else.""  ""Nobody's controlling me.""  He laughed. ""Oh yeah? See you around, kid.""  I balled up my fists. ""You're pretty smug, Lord Ares, for a guy who runs from Cupid statues.""  Behind his sunglasses, fire glowed. I felt a hot wind in my hair. ""We'll meet again, Percy Jackson. Next time you're in a fight, watch your back.""  He revved his Harley, then roared off down Delancy Street.  Annabeth said, ""That was not smart, Percy.""  ""I don't care.""  ""You don't want a god as your enemy. Especially not that god.""  ""Hey, guys,"" Grover said. ""I hate to interrupt, but ...""  He pointed toward the diner. At the register, the last two customers were paying their check, two men in identical black coveralls, with a white logo on their backs that matched the one on the KINDNESS INTERNATIONAL truck.  ""If we're taking the zoo express,"" Grover said, ""we need to hurry.""  I didn't like it, but we had no better option. Besides, I'd seen enough of Denver.  We ran across the street and climbed in the back of the big rig, closing the doors behind us.  The first thing that hit me was the smell. It was like the world's biggest pan of kitty litter.  The trailer was dark inside until I uncapped Anaklusmos. The blade cast a faint bronze light over a very sad scene. Sitting in a row of filthy metal cages were three of the most pathetic zoo animals I'd ever beheld: a zebra, a male albino lion, and some weird antelope thing I didn't know the name for.  Someone had thrown the lion a sack of turnips, which he obviously didn't want to eat. The zebra and the antelope had each gotten a Styrofoam tray of hamburger meat. The zebra's mane was matted with chewing gum, like somebody had been spitting on it in their spare time. The antelope had a stupid silver birthday balloon tied to one of his horns that read OVER THE HILL!  Apparently, nobody had wanted to get close enough to the lion to mess with him, but the poor thing was pacing around on soiled blankets, in a space way too small for him, panting from the stuffy heat of the trailer. He had flies buzzing around his pink eyes and his ribs showed through his white fur.  ""This is kindness?"" Grover yelled. ""Humane zoo transport?""  He probably would've gone right back outside to beat up the truckers with his reed pipes, and I would've helped him, but just then the trucks engine roared to life, the trailer started shaking, and we were forced to sit down or fall down.  We huddled in the corner on some mildewed feed sacks, trying to ignore the smell and the heat and the flies. Grover talked to the animals in a series of goat bleats, but they just stared at him sadly. Annabeth was in favor of breaking the cages and freeing them on the spot, but I pointed out it wouldn't do much good until the truck stopped moving. Besides, I had a feeling we might look a lot better to the lion than those turnips.  I found a water jug and refilled their bowls, then used Anaklusmos to drag the mismatched food out of their cages. I gave the meat to the lion and the turnips to the zebra and the antelope.  Grover calmed the antelope down, while Annabeth used her knife to cut the balloon off his horn. She wanted to cut the gum out of the zebra's mane, too, but we decided that would be too risky with the truck bumping around. We told Grover to promise the animals we'd help them more in the morning, then we settled in for night.  Grover curled up on a turnip sack; Annabeth opened our bag of Double Stuf Oreos and nibbled on one halfheartedly; I tried to cheer myself up by concentrating on the fact that we were halfway to Los Angeles. Halfway to our destination. It was only June fourteenth. The solstice wasn't until the twenty-first. We could make it in plenty of time.  On the other hand, I had no idea what to expect next. The gods kept toying with me. At least Hephaestus had the decency to be honest about it—he'd put up cameras and advertised me as entertainment. But even when the cameras weren't rolling, I had a feeling my quest was being watched. I was a source of amusement for the gods.  ""Hey,"" Annabeth said, ""I'm sorry for freaking out back at the water park, Percy.""  ""That's okay.""  ""It's just..."" She shuddered. ""Spiders.""  ""Because of the Arachne story,"" I guessed. ""She got turned into a spider for challenging your mom to a weaving contest, right?""  Annabeth nodded. ""Arachne's children have been taking revenge on the children of Athena ever since. If there's a spider within a mile of me, it'll find me. I hate the creepy little things. Anyway, I owe you.""  ""We're a team, remember?"" I said. ""Besides, Grover did the fancy flying.""  I thought he was asleep, but he mumbled from the corner, ""I was pretty amazing, wasn't I?""  Annabeth and I laughed.  She pulled apart an Oreo, handed me half. ""In the Iris message ... did Luke really say nothing?""  I munched my cookie and thought about how to answer. The conversation via rainbow had bothered me all evening. ""Luke said you and he go way back. He also said Grover wouldn't fail this time. Nobody would turn into a pine tree.""  In the dim bronze light of the sword blade, it was hard to read their expressions.  Grover let out a mournful bray.  ""I should've told you the truth from the beginning."" His voice trembled. ""I thought if you knew what a failure I was, you wouldn't want me along.""  ""You were the satyr who tried to rescue Thalia, the daughter of Zeus.""  He nodded glumly.  ""And the other two half-bloods Thalia befriended, the ones who got safely to camp ..."" I looked at Annabeth. ""That was you and Luke, wasn't it?""  She put down her Oreo, uneaten. ""Like you said, Percy, a seven-year-old half-blood wouldn't have made it very far alone. Athena guided me toward help. Thalia was twelve. Luke was fourteen. They'd both run away from home, like me. They were happy to take me with them. They were ... amazing monster-fighters, even without training. We traveled north from Virginia without any real plans, fending off monsters for about two weeks before Grover found us.""  ""I was supposed to escort Thalia to camp,"" he said, sniffling. ""Only Thalia. I had strict orders from Chiron: don't do anything that would slow down the rescue. We knew Hades was after her, see, but I couldn't just leave Luke and Annabeth by themselves. I thought ... I thought I could lead all three of them to safety. It was my fault the Kindly Ones caught up with us. I froze. I got scared on the way back to camp and took some wrong turns. If I'd just been a little quicker ...""  ""Stop it,"" Annabeth said. ""No one blames you. Thalia didn't blame you either.""  ""She sacrificed herself to save us,"" he said miserably, ""Her death was my fault. The Council of Cloven Elders said so.""  ""Because you wouldn't leave two other half-bloods behind?"" I said. ""That's not fair."" ""Percy's right,"" Annabeth said. ""I wouldn't be here today if it weren't for you, Grover. Neither would Luke. We don't care what the council says.""  Grover kept sniffling in the dark. ""It's just my luck. I'm the lamest satyr ever, and I find the two most powerful half-bloods of the century, Thalia and Percy.""  ""You're not lame,"" Annabeth insisted. ""You've got more courage than any satyr I've ever met. Name one other who would dare go to the Underworld. I bet Percy is really glad you're here right now.""  She kicked me in the shin.  ""Yeah,"" I said, which I would've done even without the kick. ""It's not luck that you found Thalia and me, Grover. You've got the biggest heart of any satyr ever. You're a natural searcher. That's why you'll be the one who finds Pan.""  I heard a deep, satisfied sigh. I waited for Grover to say something, but his breathing only got heavier. When the sound turned to snoring, I realized he'd fallen sleep.  ""How does he do that?"" I marveled.  ""I don't know,"" Annabeth said. ""But that was really a nice thing you told him.""  ""I meant it.""  We rode in silence for a few miles, bumping around on the feed sacks. The zebra munched a turnip. The lion licked the last of the hamburger meat off his lips and looked at me hopefully.  Annabeth rubbed her necklace like she was thinking deep, strategic thoughts.  ""That pine-tree bead,"" I said. ""Is that from your first year?""  She looked. She hadn't realized what she was doing.  ""Yeah,"" she said. ""Every August, the counselors pick the most important event of the summer, and they paint it on that year's beads. I've got Thalia's pine tree, a Greek trireme on fire, a centaur in a prom dress—now that was a weird summer....""  ""And the college ring is your father's?""  ""That's none of your—"" She stopped herself. ""Yeah. Yeah, it is.""  ""You don't have to tell me.""  ""No ... it's okay."" She took a shaky breath. ""My dad sent it to me folded up in a letter, two summers ago. The ring was, like, his main keepsake from Athena. He wouldn't have gotten through his doctoral program at Harvard without her.... That's a long story. Anyway, he said he wanted me to have it. He apologized for being a jerk, said he loved me and missed me. He wanted me to come home and live with him.""  ""That doesn't sound so bad.""  ""Yeah, well... the problem was, I believed him. I tried to go home for that school year, but my stepmom was the same as ever. She didn't want her kids put in danger by living with a freak. Monsters attacked. We argued. Monsters attacked. We argued. I didn't even make it through winter break. I called Chiron and came right back to CampHalf-Blood.""  ""You think you'll ever try living with your dad again?""  She wouldn't meet my eyes. ""Please. I'm not into self-inflicted pain.""  ""You shouldn't give up,"" I told her. ""You should write him a letter or something.""  ""Thanks for the advice,"" she said coldly, ""but my father's made his choice about who he wants to live with.""  We passed another few miles of silence.  ""So if the gods fight,"" I said, ""will things line up the way they did with the Trojan War? Will it be Athena versus Poseidon?""  She put her head against the backpack Ares had given us, and closed her eyes. ""I don't know what my mom will do. I just know I'll fight next to you.""  ""Why?""  ""Because you're my friend, Seaweed Brain. Any more stupid questions?""  I couldn't think of an answer for that. Fortunately I didn't have to. Annabeth was asleep.  I had trouble following her example, with Grover snoring and an albino lion staring hungrily at me, but eventually I closed my eyes.  * * *  My nightmare started out as something I'd dreamed a million times before: I was being forced to take a standardized test while wearing a straitjacket. All the other kids were going out to recess, and the teacher kept saying, Come on, Percy. You're not stupid, are you? Pick up your pencil.  Then the dream strayed from the usual.  I looked over at the next desk and saw a girl sitting there, also wearing a straitjacket. She was my age, with unruly black, punk-style hair, dark eyeliner around her stormy green eyes, and freckles across her nose. Somehow, I knew who she was. She was Thalia, daughter of Zeus.  She struggled against the straitjacket, glared at me in frustration, and snapped, Well, Seaweed Brain? One of us has to get out of here.  She's right, my dream-self thought. I'm going back to that cavern. I'm going to give Hades a piece of my mind.  The straitjacket melted off me. I fell through the classroom floor. The teacher's voice changed until it was cold and evil, echoing from the depths of a great chasm.  Percy Jackson, it said. Yes, the exchange went well, 1 see.  I was back in the dark cavern, spirits of the dead drifting around me. Unseen in the pit, the monstrous thing was speaking, but this time it wasn't addressing me. The numbing power of its voice seemed directed somewhere else.  And he suspects nothing? it asked.  Another voice, one I almost recognized, answered at my shoulder. Nothing, my lord. He is as ignorant as the rest.  I looked over, but no one was there. The speaker was invisible.  Deception upon deception, the thing in the pit mused aloud. Excellent.  Truly, my lord, said the voice next to me, you are well-named the Crooked One. But was it really necessary? I could have brought you what I stole directly —  You? the monster said in scorn. You have already shown your limits. You would have failed me completely had I not intervened.  But, my lord—  Peace, little servant. Our six months have bought us much. Zeus's anger has grown. Poseidon has played his most desperate card. Now we shall use it against him. Shortly you shall have the reward you wish, and your revenge. As soon as both items are delivered into my hands ... but wait. He is here.  What? The invisible servant suddenly sounded tense. You summoned him, my lord?  No. The full force of the monsters attention was now pouring over me, freezing me in place. Blast his father's blood—he is too changeable, too unpredictable. The boy brought himself hither.  Impossible! the servant cried.  For a weakling such as you, perhaps, the voice snarled. Then its cold power turned back on me. So ... you wish to dream of your quest, young half-blood? Then I will oblige.  The scene changed.  I was standing in a vast throne room with black marble walls and bronze floors. The empty, horrid throne was made from human bones fused together. Standing at the foot of the dais was my mother, frozen in shimmering golden light, her arms outstretched.  I tried to step toward her, but my legs wouldn't move. I reached for her, only to realize that my hands were withering to bones. Grinning skeletons in Greek armor crowded around me, draping me with silk robes, wreathing my head with laurels that smoked with Chimera poison, burning into my scalp.  The evil voice began to laugh. Hail, the conquering hero!  I woke with a start.  Grover was shaking my shoulder. ""The truck's stopped,"" he said. ""We think they're coming to check on the animals.""  ""Hide!"" Annabeth hissed.  She had it easy. She just put on her magic cap and disappeared. Grover and I had to dive behind feed sacks and hope we looked like turnips.  The trailer doors creaked open. Sunlight and heat poured in.  ""Man!"" one of the truckers said, waving his hand in front of his ugly nose. ""I wish I hauled appliances."" He climbed inside and poured some water from a jug into the animals' dishes.  ""You hot, big boy?"" he asked the lion, then splashed the rest of the bucket right in the lion's face.  The lion roared in indignation.  ""Yeah, yeah, yeah,"" the man said.  Next to me, under the turnip sacks, Grover tensed. For a peace-loving herbivore, he looked downright murderous.  The trucker threw the antelope a squashed-looking Happy Meal bag. He smirked at the zebra. ""How ya doin', Stripes? Least we'll be getting rid of you this stop. You like magic shows? You're gonna love this one. They're gonna saw you in half!""  The zebra, wild-eyed with fear, looked straight at me.  There was no sound, but as clear as day, I heard it say: Free me, lord. Please.  I was too stunned to react.  There was a loud knock, knock, knock on the side of the trailer.  The trucker inside with us yelled, ""What do you want, Eddie?""  A voice outside—it must've been Eddie's—shouted back, ""Maurice? What'd ya say?""  ""What are you banging for?""  Knock, knock, knock.  Outside, Eddie yelled, ""What banging?""  Our guy Maurice rolled his eyes and went back outside, cursing at Eddie for being an idiot.  A second later, Annabeth appeared next to me. She must've done the banging to get Maurice out of the trailer. She said, ""This transport business can't be legal.""  ""No kidding,"" Grover said. He paused, as if listening. ""The lion says these guys are animal smugglers!""  That's right, the zebra's voice said in my mind.  ""We've got to free them!"" Grover said. He and Annabeth both looked at me, waiting for my lead.  I'd heard the zebra talk, but not the lion. Why? Maybe it was another learning disability ... I could only understand zebras? Then I thought: horses. What had Annabeth said about Poseidon creating horses? Was a zebra close enough to a horse? Was that why I could understand it?  The zebra said, Open my cage, lord. Please. I'll be fine after that.  Outside, Eddie and Maurice were still yelling at each other, but I knew they'd be coming inside to torment the animals again any minute. I grabbed Riptide and slashed the lock off the zebra's cage.  The zebra burst out. It turned to me and bowed. Thank you, lord.  Grover held up his hands and said something to the zebra in goat talk, like a blessing.  Just as Maurice was poking his head back inside to check out the noise, the zebra leaped over him and into the street. There was yelling and screaming and cars honking. We rushed to the doors of the trailer in time to see the zebra galloping down a wide boulevard lined with hotels and casinos and neon signs. We'd just released a zebra in Las Vegas.  Maurice and Eddie ran after it, with a few policemen running after them, shouting, ""Hey! You need a permit for that!""  ""Now would be a good time to leave,"" Annabeth said.  ""The other animals first,"" Grover said.  I cut the locks with my sword. Grover raised his hands and spoke the same goat-blessing he'd used for the zebra.  ""Good luck,"" I told the animals. The antelope and the lion burst out of their cages and went off together into the streets.  Some tourists screamed. Most just backed off and took pictures, probably thinking it was some kind of stunt by one of the casinos.  ""Will the animals be okay?"" I asked Grover. ""I mean, the desert and all—""  ""Don't worry,"" he said. ""I placed a satyr's sanctuary on them.""  ""Meaning?""  ""Meaning they'll reach the wild safely,"" he said. ""They'll find water, food, shade, whatever they need until they find a safe place to live.""  ""Why can't you place a blessing like that on us?"" I asked. ""It only works on wild animals.""  ""So it would only affect Percy,"" Annabeth reasoned.  ""Hey!"" I protested.  ""Kidding,"" she said. ""Come on. Let's get out of this filthy truck.""  We stumbled out into the desert afternoon. It was a hundred and ten degrees, easy, and we must've looked like deep-fried vagrants, but everybody was too interested in the wild animals to pay us much attention.  We passed the Monte Carlo and the MGM. We passed pyramids, a pirate ship, and the Statue of Liberty, which was a pretty small replica, but still made me homesick.  I wasn't sure what we were looking for. Maybe just a place to get out of the heat for a few minutes, find a sandwich and a glass of lemonade, make a new plan for getting west.  We must have taken a wrong turn, because we found ourselves at a dead end, standing in front of the Lotus Hotel and Casino. The entrance was a huge neon flower, the petals lighting up and blinking. No one was going in or out, but the glittering chrome doors were open, spilling out air-conditioning that smelled like flowers—lotus blossom, maybe. I'd never smelled one, so I wasn't sure.  The doorman smiled at us. ""Hey, kids. You look tired. You want to come in and sit down?""  I'd learned to be suspicious, the last week or so. I figured anybody might be a monster or a god. You just couldn't tell. But this guy was normal. One look at him, and I could see. Besides, I was so relieved to hear somebody who sounded sympathetic that I nodded and said we'd love to come in. Inside, we took one look around, and Grover said, ""Whoa.""  The whole lobby was a giant game room. And I'm not talking about cheesy old Pac-Man games or slot machines. There was an indoor waterslide snaking around the glass elevator, which went straight up at least forty floors. There was a climbing wall on the side of one building, and an indoor bungee-jumping bridge. There were virtual-reality suits with working laser guns. And hundreds of video games, each one the size of a widescreen TV. Basically, you name it, this place had it. There were a few other kids playing, but not that many. No waiting for any of the games. There were waitresses and snack bars all around, serving every kind of food you can imagine.  ""Hey!"" a bellhop said. At least I guessed he was a bellhop. He wore a white-and-yellow Hawaiian shirt with lotus designs, shorts, and flip-flops. ""Welcome to the Lotus Casino. Here's your room key.""  I stammered, ""Um, but...""  ""No, no,"" he said, laughing. ""The bill's taken care of. No extra charges, no tips. Just go on up to the top floor, loom 4001. If you need anything, like extra bubbles for the hot tub, or skeet targets for the shooting range, or whatever, just call the front desk. Here are your LotusCash cards. They work in the restaurants and on all the games and rides.""  He handed us each a green plastic credit card.  I knew there must be some mistake. Obviously he thought we were some millionaire's kids. But I took the card and said, ""How much is on here?""  His eyebrows knit together. ""What do you mean?""  ""I mean, when does it run out of cash?""  He laughed. ""Oh, you're making a joke. Hey, that's cool. Enjoy your stay.""  We took the elevator upstairs and checked out our room. It was a suite with three separate bedrooms and a bar stocked with candy, sodas, and chips. A hotline to room service. Fluffy towels and water beds with feather pillows. A big-screen television with satellite and high-speed Internet. The balcony had its own hot tub, and sure enough, there was a skeet-shooting machine and a shotgun, so you could launch clay pigeons right out over the Las Vegas skyline and plug them with your gun. I didn't see how that could be legal, but I thought it was pretty cool. The view over the Strip and the desert was amazing, though I doubted we'd ever find time to look at the view with a room like this.  ""Oh, goodness,"" Annabeth said. ""This place is ...""  ""Sweet,"" Grover said. ""Absolutely sweet.""  There were clothes in the closet, and they fit me. I frowned, thinking that this was a little strange.  I threw Ares's backpack in the trash can. Wouldn't need that anymore. When we left, I could just charge a new one at the hotel store.  I took a shower, which felt awesome after a week of grimy travel. I changed clothes, ate a bag of chips, drank three Cokes, and came out feeling better than I had in a long time. In the back of my mind, some small problem kept nagging me. I'd had a dream or something ... I needed to talk to my friends. But I was sure it could wait.  I came out of the bedroom and found that Annabeth and Grover had also showered and changed clothes. Grover was eating potato chips to his heart's content, while Annabeth cranked up the National Geographic Channel.  ""All those stations,"" I told her, ""and you turn on National Geographic. Are you insane?""  ""It's interesting.""  ""I feel good,"" Grover said. ""I love this place.""  Without his even realizing it, the wings sprouted out of his shoes and lifted him a foot off the ground, then back down again.  ""So what now?"" Annabeth asked. ""Sleep?""  Grover and I looked at each other and grinned. We both held up our green plastic LotusCash cards.  ""Play time,"" I said.  I couldn't remember the last time I had so much fun. I came from a relatively poor family. Our idea of a splurge was eating out at Burger King and renting a video. A five-star Vegas hotel? Forget it.  I bungee-jumped the lobby five or six times, did the waterslide, snowboarded the artificial ski slope, and played virtual-reality laser tag and FBI sharpshooter. I saw Grover a few times, going from game to game. He really liked the reverse hunter thing—where the deer go out and shoot the rednecks. I saw Annabeth playing trivia games and other brainiac stuff. They had this huge 3-D sim game where you build your own city, and you could actually see the holographic buildings rise on the display board. I didn't think much of it, but Annabeth loved it.  I'm not sure when I first realized something was wrong.  Probably, it was when I noticed the guy standing next to me at VR sharpshooters. He was about thirteen, I guess, but his clothes were weird. I thought he was some Elvis impersonator's son. He wore bell-bottom jeans and a red T-shirt with black piping, and his hair was permed and gelled like a New Jersey girl's on homecoming night.  We played a game of sharpshooters together and he said, ""Groovy, man. Been here two weeks, and the games keep getting better and better.""  Groovy?  Later, while we were talking, I said something was ""sick,"" and he looked at me kind of startled, as if he'd never heard the word used that way before.  He said his name was Darrin, but as soon as I started asking him questions he got bored with me and started to go back to the computer screen.  I said, ""Hey, Darrin?""  ""What?""  ""What year is it?""  He frowned at me. ""In the game?""  ""No. In real life.""  He had to think about it. ""1977.""  ""No,"" I said, getting a little scared. ""Really.""  ""Hey, man. Bad vibes. I got a game happening.""  After that he totally ignored me.  I started talking to people, and I found it wasn't easy. They were glued to the TV screen, or the video game, or their food, or whatever. I found a guy who told me it was 1985. Another guy told me it was 1993. They all claimed they hadn't been in here very long, a few days, a few weeks at most. They didn't really know and they didn't care.  Then it occurred to me: how long had I been here? It seemed like only a couple of hours, but was it?  I tried to remember why we were here. We were going to Los Angeles. We were supposed to find the entrance to the Underworld. My mother ... for a scary second, I had trouble remembering her name. Sally. Sally Jackson. I had to find her. I had to stop Hades from causing World War III.  I found Annabeth still building her city.  ""Come on,"" I told her. ""We've got to get out of here.""  No response.  I shook her. ""Annabeth?""  She looked up, annoyed. ""What?  ""We need to leave.""  ""Leave? What are you talking about? I've just got the towers—""  ""This place is a trap.""  She didn't respond until I shook her again. ""What?""  ""Listen. The Underworld. Our quest!""  ""Oh, come on, Percy. Just a few more minutes.""  ""Annabeth, there are people here from 1977. Kids who have never aged. You check in, and you stay forever.""  ""So?"" she asked. ""Can you imagine a better place?""  I grabbed her wrist and yanked her away from the game.  ""Hey!"" She screamed and hit me, but nobody else even bothered looking at us. They were too busy.  I made her look directly in my eyes. I said, ""Spiders. Large, hairy spiders.""  That jarred her. Her vision cleared. ""Oh my gods,"" she said. ""How long have we—""  ""I don't know, but we've got to find Grover.""  We went searching, and found him still playing Virtual Deer Hunter.  ""Grover!"" we both shouted.  He said, ""Die, human! Die, silly polluting nasty person!""  ""Grover!""  He turned the plastic gun on me and started clicking, as if I were just another image from the screen.  I looked at Annabeth, and together we took Grover by the arms and dragged him away. His flying shoes sprang to life and started tugging his legs in the other direction as he shouted, ""No! I just got to a new level! No!""  The Lotus bellhop hurried up to us. ""Well, now, are you ready for your platinum cards?""  ""We're leaving,"" I told him.  ""Such a shame,"" he said, and I got the feeling that he really meant it, that we'd be breaking his heart if we went. ""We just added an entire new floor full of games for platinum-card members.""  He held out the cards, and I wanted one. I knew that if I took one, I'd never leave. I'd stay here, happy forever, playing games forever, and soon I'd forget my mom, and my quest, and maybe even my own name. I'd be playing virtual rifleman with groovy Disco Darrin forever.  Grover reached for the card, but Annabeth yanked back his arm and said, ""No, thanks.""  We walked toward the door, and as we did, the smell of the food and the sounds of the games seemed to get more and more inviting. I thought about our room upstairs. We could just stay the night, sleep in a real bed for once....  Then we burst through the doors of the Lotus Casino and ran down the sidewalk. It felt like afternoon, about the same time of day we'd gone into the casino, but something was wrong. The weather had completely changed. It was stormy, with heat lightning flashing out in the desert.  Ares's backpack was slung over my shoulder, which was odd, because I was sure I had thrown it in the trash can in room 4001, but at the moment I had other problems to worry about.  I ran to the nearest newspaper stand and read the year first. Thank the gods, it was the same year it had been when we went in. Then I noticed the date: June twentieth.  We had been in the Lotus Casino for five days.  We had only one day left until the summer solstice. One day to complete our quest."
Percy Jackson 1 Chapter 17,"It was Annabeth's idea.  She loaded us into the back of a Vegas taxi as if we actually had money, and told the driver, ""Los Angeles, please."" The cabbie chewed his cigar and sized us up. ""That's three hundred miles. For that, you gotta pay up front.""  ""You accept casino debit cards?"" Annabeth asked.  He shrugged. ""Some of 'em. Same as credit cards. I gotta swipe 'em through first.""  Annabeth handed him her green LotusCash card.  He looked at it skeptically.  ""Swipe it,"" Annabeth invited.  He did.  His meter machine started rattling. The lights flashed. Finally an infinity symbol came up next to the dollar sign.  The cigar fell out of the driver's mouth. He looked back at us, his eyes wide. ""Where to in Los Angeles... uh, Your Highness?""  ""The Santa Monica Pier."" Annabeth sat up a little straighter. I could tell she liked the ""Your Highness"" thing. ""Get us there fast, and you can keep the change.""  Maybe she shouldn't have told him that. The cab's speedometer never dipped below ninety-five the whole way through the Mojave Desert.  On the road, we had plenty of time to talk. I told Annabeth and Grover about my latest dream, but the details got sketchier the more I tried to remember them. The Lotus Casino seemed to have short-circuited my memory. I couldn't recall what the invisible servant's voice had sounded like, though I was sure it was somebody I knew. The servant had called the monster in the pit something other than ""my lord"" ... some special name or title....  ""The Silent One?"" Annabeth suggested. ""The Rich One? Both of those are nicknames for Hades.""  ""Maybe ..."" I said, though neither sounded quite right.  ""That throne room sounds like Hades's,"" Grover said. ""That's the way it's usually described.""  I shook my head. ""Something's wrong. The throne room wasn't the main part of the dream. And that voice from the pit ... I don't know. It just didn't feel like a god's voice.""  Annabeth's eyes widened.  ""What?"" I asked.  ""Oh ... nothing. I was just—No, it has to be Hades. Maybe he sent this thief, this invisible person, to get the master bolt, and something went wrong—""  ""Like what?""  ""I—I don't know,"" she said. ""But if he stole Zeus's symbol of power from Olympus, and the gods were hunting him, I mean, a lot of things could go wrong. So this thief had to hide the bolt, or he lost it somehow. Anyway, he failed to bring it to Hades. That's what the voice said in your dream, right? The guy failed. That would explain what the Furies were searching for when they came after us on the bus. Maybe they thought we had retrieved the bolt.""  I wasn't sure what was wrong with her. She looked pale.  ""But if I'd already retrieved the bolt,"" I said, ""why would I be traveling to the Underworld?""  ""To threaten Hades,"" Grover suggested. ""To bribe or blackmail him into getting your mom back.""  I whistled. ""You have evil thoughts for a goat.""  ""Why, thank you.""  ""But the thing in the pit said it was waiting for two items,"" I said. ""If the master bolt is one, what's the other?""  Grover shook his head, clearly mystified.  Annabeth was looking at me as if she knew my next question, and was silently willing me not to ask it.  ""You have an idea what might be in that pit, don't you?"" I asked her. ""I mean, if it isn't Hades?""  ""Percy ... let's not talk about it. Because if it isn't Hades ... No. It has to be Hades.""  Wasteland rolled by. We passed a sign that said CALIFORNIA STATE LINE, 12 MILES.  I got the feeling I was missing one simple, critical piece of information. It was like when I stared at a common word I should know, but I couldn't make sense of it because one or two letters were floating around. The more I thought about my quest, the more I was sure that confronting Hades wasn't the real answer. There was something else going on, something even more dangerous.  The problem was: we were hurtling toward the Underworld at ninety-five miles an hour, betting that Hades had the master bolt. If we got there and found out we were wrong, we wouldn't have time to correct ourselves. The solstice deadline would pass and war would begin.  ""The answer is in the Underworld,"" Annabeth assured me. ""You saw spirits of the dead, Percy. There's only one place that could be. We're doing the right thing.""  She tried to boost our morale by suggesting clever strategies for getting into the Land of the Dead, but my heart wasn't in it. There were just too many unknown factors. It was like cramming for a test without knowing the subject. And believe me, I'd done that enough times.  The cab sped west. Every gust of wind through Death Valley sounded like a spirit of the dead. Every time the brakes hissed on an eighteen-wheeler, it reminded me of Echidna's reptilian voice.  At sunset, the taxi dropped us at the beach in Santa Monica. It looked exactly the way L.A. beaches do in the movies, only it smelled worse. There were carnival rides lining the Pier, palm trees lining the sidewalks, homeless guys sleeping in the sand dunes, and surfer dudes waiting for the perfect wave.  Grover, Annabeth, and I walked down to the edge of the surf.  ""What now?"" Annabeth asked.  The Pacific was turning gold in the setting sun. I thought about how long it had been since I'd stood on the beach at Montauk, on the opposite side of the country, looking out at a different sea.  How could there be a god who could control all that? What did my science teacher used to say—two-thirds of the earth's surface was covered in water? How could I be the son of someone that powerful?  I stepped into the surf.  ""Percy?"" Annabeth said. ""What are you doing?""  I kept walking, up to my waist, then my chest.  She called after me, ""You know how polluted that water is? There're all kinds of toxic—""  That's when my head went under.  I held my breath at first. It's difficult to intentionally inhale water. Finally I couldn't stand it anymore. I gasped. Sure enough, I could breathe normally.  I walked down into the shoals. I shouldn't have been able to see through the murk, but somehow I could tell where everything was. I could sense the rolling texture of the bottom. I could make out sand-dollar colonies dotting the sandbars. I could even see the currents, warm and cold streams swirling together.  I felt something rub against my leg. I looked down and almost shot out of the water like a ballistic missile. Sliding along beside me was a five-foot-long mako shark.  But the thing wasn't attacking. It was nuzzling me. Heeling like a dog. Tentatively, I touched its dorsal fin. It bucked a little, as if inviting me to hold tighter. I grabbed the fin with both hands. It took off, pulling me along. The shark carried me down into the darkness. It deposited me at the edge of the ocean proper, where the sand bank dropped off into a huge chasm. It was like standing on the rim of the Grand Canyon at midnight, not being able to see much, but knowing the void was right there.  The surface shimmered maybe a hundred and fifty feet above. I knew I should've been crushed by the pressure. Then again, I shouldn't have been able to breathe. I wondered if there was a limit to how deep I could go, if I could sink straight to the bottom of the Pacific.  Then I saw something glimmering in the darkness below, growing bigger and brighter as it rose toward me. A woman's voice, like my mother's, called: ""Percy Jackson.""  As she got closer, her shape became clearer. She had flowing black hair, a dress made of green silk. Light flickered around her, and her eyes were so distractingly beautiful I hardly noticed the stallion-sized sea horse she was riding.  She dismounted. The sea horse and the mako shark whisked off and started playing something that looked like tag. The underwater lady smiled at me. ""You've come far, Percy Jackson. Well done.""  I wasn't quite sure what to do, so I bowed. ""You're the woman who spoke to me in the Mississippi River.""  ""Yes, child. I am a Nereid, a spirit of the sea. It was not easy to appear so far upriver, but the naiads, my freshwater cousins, helped sustain my life force. They honor Lord Poseidon, though they do not serve in his court.""  ""And ... you serve in Poseidon's court?""  She nodded. ""It has been many years since a child of the Sea God has been born. We have watched you with great interest.""  Suddenly I remembered faces in the waves off MontaukBeach when I was a little boy, reflections of smiling women. Like so many of the weird things in my life, I'd never given it much thought before.  ""If my father is so interested in me,"" I said, ""why isn't he here? Why doesn't he speak to me?""  A cold current rose out of the depths.  ""Do not judge the Lord of the Sea too harshly,"" the Nereid told me. ""He stands at the brink of an unwanted war. He has much to occupy his time. Besides, he is forbidden to help you directly. The gods may not show such favoritism.""  ""Even to their own children?""  ""Especially to them. The gods can work by indirect influence only. That is why I give you a warning, and a gift.""  She held out her hand. Three white pearls flashed in her palm.  ""I know you journey to Hades's realm,"" she said. ""Few mortals have ever done this and survived: Orpheus, who had great music skill; Hercules, who had great strength; Houdini, who could escape even the depths of Tartarus. Do you have these talents?""  ""Urn ... no, ma'am.""  ""Ah, but you have something else, Percy. You have gifts you have only begun to know. The oracles have foretold a great and terrible future for you, should you survive to manhood. Poseidon would not have you die before your time. Therefore take these, and when you are in need, smash a pearl at your feet.""  ""What will happen?""  ""That,"" she said, ""depends on the need. But remember: what belongs to the sea will always return to the sea.""  ""What about the warning?""  Her eyes flickered with green light. ""Go with what your heart tells you, or you will lose all. Hades feeds on doubt and hopelessness. He will trick you if he can, make you mistrust your own judgment. Once you are in his realm, he will never willingly let you leave. Keep faith. Good luck, Percy Jackson.""  She summoned her sea horse and rode toward the void.  ""Wait!"" I called. ""At the river, you said not to trust the gifts. What gifts?""  ""Good-bye, young hero,"" she called back, her voice fading into the depths. ""You must listen to your heart."" She became a speck of glowing green, and then she was gone.  I wanted to follow her down into the darkness. I wanted to see the court of Poseidon. But I looked up at the sunset darkening on the surface. My friends were waiting. We had so little time....  I kicked upward toward the shore.  When I reached the beach, my clothes dried instantly. I told Grover and Annabeth what had happened, and showed them the pearls.  Annabeth grimaced. ""No gift comes without a price.""  ""They were free.""  ""No."" She shook her head. ""'There is no such thing as a free lunch.' That's an ancient Greek saying that translated pretty well into American. There will be a price. You wait.""  On that happy thought, we turned our backs on the sea.  With some spare change from Ares's backpack, we took the bus into West Hollywood. I showed the driver the Underworld address slip I'd taken from Aunty Em's Garden Gnome Emporium, but he'd never heard of DOA Recording Studios. ""You remind me of somebody I saw on TV,"" he told me. ""You a child actor or something?""  ""Uh ... I'm a stunt double ... for a lot of child actors.""  ""Oh! That explains it.""  We thanked him and got off quickly at the next stop.  We wandered for miles on foot, looking for DOA. Nobody seemed to know where it was. It didn't appear in the phone book.  Twice, we ducked into alleys to avoid cop cars.  I froze in front of an appliance-store window because a television was playing an interview with somebody who looked very familiar—my stepdad, Smelly Gabe. He was talking to Barbara Walters—I mean, as if he were some kind of huge celebrity. She was interviewing him in our apartment, in the middle of a poker game, and there was a young blond lady sitting next to him, patting his hand.  A fake tear glistened on his cheek. He was saying, ""Honest, Ms. Walters, if it wasn't for Sugar here, my grief counselor, I'd be a wreck. My stepson took everything I cared about. My wife ... my Camaro ... I—I'm sorry. I have trouble talking about it.""  ""There you have it, America."" Barbara Walters turned to the camera. ""A man torn apart. An adolescent boy with serious issues. Let me show you, again, the last known photo of this troubled young fugitive, taken a week ago in Denver.""  The screen cut to a grainy shot of me, Annabeth, and Grover standing outside the Colorado diner, talking to Ares.  ""Who are the other children in this photo?"" Barbara Walters asked dramatically. ""Who is the man with them? Is Percy Jackson a delinquent, a terrorist, or perhaps the brainwashed victim of a frightening new cult? When we come back, we chat with a leading child psychologist. Stay tuned, America.""  ""C'mon,"" Grover told me. He hauled me away before I could punch a hole in the appliance-store window.  It got dark, and hungry-looking characters started coming out on the streets to play. Now, don't get me wrong. I'm a New Yorker. I don't scare easy. But L.A. had a totally different feel from New York. Back home, everything seemed close. It didn't matter how big the city was, you could get anywhere without getting lost. The street pattern and the subway made sense. There was a system to how things worked. A kid could be safe as long as he wasn't stupid.  L.A. wasn't like that. It was spread out, chaotic, hard to move around. It reminded me of Ares. It wasn't enough for L.A. to be big; it had to prove it was big by being loud and strange and difficult to navigate, too. I didn't know how we were ever going to find the entrance to the Underworld by tomorrow, the summer solstice.  We walked past gangbangers, bums, and street hawkers, who looked at us like they were trying to figure if we were worth the trouble of mugging.  As we hurried passed the entrance of an alley, a voice from the darkness said, ""Hey, you.""  Like an idiot, I stopped.  Before I knew it, we were surrounded. A gang of kids had circled us. Six of them in all—white kids with expensive clothes and mean faces. Like the kids at YancyAcademy: rich brats playing at being bad boys.  Instinctively, I uncapped Riptide.  When the sword appeared out of nowhere, the kids backed off, but their leader was either really stupid or really brave, because he kept coming at me with a switchblade.  I made the mistake of swinging.  The kid yelped. But he must've been one hundred percent mortal, because the blade passed harmlessly right through his chest. He looked down. ""What the ...""  I figured I had about three seconds before his shock turned to anger. ""Run!"" I screamed at Annabeth and Grover.  We pushed two kids out of the way and raced down the street, not knowing where we were going. We turned a sharp corner.  ""There!"" Annabeth shouted.  Only one store on the block looked open, its windows glaring with neon. The sign above the door said something like CRSTUY'S WATRE BDE ALPACE.  ""Crusty's WaterBedPalace?"" Grover translated.  It didn't sound like a place I'd ever go except in an emergency, but this definitely qualified.  We burst through the doors, ran behind a water bed, and ducked. A split second later, the gang kids ran past outside.  ""I think we lost them,"" Grover panted.  A voice behind us boomed, ""Lost who?""  We all jumped.  Standing behind us was a guy who looked like a raptor in a leisure suit. He was at least seven feet tall, with absolutely no hair. He had gray, leathery skin, thick-lidded eyes, and a cold, reptilian smile. He moved toward us slowly, but I got the feeling he could move fast if he needed to.  His suit might've come from the Lotus Casino. It belonged back in the seventies, big-time. The shirt was silk paisley, unbuttoned halfway down his hairless chest. The lapels on his velvet jacket were as wide as landing strips. The silver chains around his neck—I couldn't even count them.  ""I'm Crusty,"" he said, with a tartar-yellow smile.  I resisted the urge to say, Yes, you are.  ""Sorry to barge in,"" I told him. ""We were just, um, browsing.""  ""You mean hiding from those no-good kids,"" he grumbled. ""They hang around every night. I get a lot of people in here, thanks to them. Say, you want to look at a water bed?""  I was about to say No, thanks, when he put a huge paw on my shoulder and steered me deeper into the showroom.  There was every kind of water bed you could imagine: different kinds of wood, different patterns of sheets; queen-size, king-size, emperor-of-the-universe-size.  ""This is my most popular model."" Crusty spread his hands proudly over a bed covered with black satin sheets, with built-in Lava Lamps on the headboard. The mattress vibrated, so it looked like oil-flavored Jell-O.  ""Million-hand massage,"" Crusty told us. ""Go on, try it out. Shoot, take a nap. I don't care. No business today, any-way.  ""Um,"" I said, ""I don't think ...""  ""Million-hand massage!"" Grover cried, and dove in. ""Oh, you guys! This is cool.""  ""Hmm,"" Crusty said, stroking his leathery chin. ""Almost, almost.""  ""Almost what?"" I asked.  He looked at Annabeth. ""Do me a favor and try this one over here, honey. Might fit.""  Annabeth said, ""But what—""  He patted her reassuringly on the shoulder and led her over to the Safari Deluxe model with teakwood lions carved into the frame and a leopard-patterned comforter. When Annabeth didn't want to lie down, Crusty pushed her.  ""Hey!"" she protested.  Crusty snapped his fingers. ""Ergo!""  Ropes sprang from the sides of the bed, lashing around Annabeth, holding her to the mattress.  Grover tried to get up, but ropes sprang from his black-satin bed, too, and lashed him down.  ""N-not c-c-cool!"" he yelled, his voice vibrating from the million-hand massage. ""N-not c-cool a-at all!""  The giant looked at Annabeth, then turned toward me and grinned. ""Almost, darn it.""  I tried to step away, but his hand shot out and clamped around the back of my neck. ""Whoa, kid. Don't worry. We'll find you one in a sec.""  ""Let my friends go.""  ""Oh, sure I will. But I got to make them fit, first.""  ""What do you mean?""  ""All the beds are exactly six feet, see? Your friends are too short. Got to make them fit.""  Annabeth and Grover kept struggling.  ""Can't stand imperfect measurements,"" Crusty muttered. ""Ergo!""  A new set of ropes leaped out from the top and bottom of the beds, wrapping around Grover and Annabeth's ankles, then around their armpits. The ropes started tightening, pulling my friends from both ends.  ""Don't worry,"" Crusty told me, ""These are stretching jobs. Maybe three extra inches on their spines. They might even live. Now why don't we find a bed you like, huh?""  ""Percy!"" Grover yelled.  My mind was racing. I knew I couldn't take on this giant water-bed salesman alone. He would snap my neck before I ever got my sword out.  ""Your real name's not Crusty, is it?"" I asked.  ""Legally, it's Procrustes,"" he admitted.  ""The Stretcher,"" I said. I remembered the story: the giant who'd tried to kill Theseus with excess hospitality on his way to Athens.  ""Yeah,"" the salesman said. ""But who can pronounce Procrustes? Bad for business. Now 'Crusty,' anybody can say that.""  ""You're right. It's got a good ring to it.""  His eyes lit up. ""You think so?""  ""Oh, absolutely,"" I said. ""And the workmanship on these beds? Fabulous!""  He grinned hugely, but his fingers didn't loosen on my neck. ""I tell my customers that. Every time. Nobody bothers to look at the workmanship. How many built-in Lava Lamp headboards have you seen?""  ""Not too many.""  ""That's right!""  ""Percy!"" Annabeth yelled. ""What are you doing?""  ""Don't mind her,"" I told Procrustes. ""She's impossible.""  The giant laughed. ""All my customers are. Never six feet exactly. So inconsiderate. And then they complain about the fitting.""  ""What do you do if they're longer than six feet?""  ""Oh, that happens all the time. It's a simple fix.""  He let go of my neck, but before I could react, he reached behind a nearby sales desk and brought out a huge double-bladed brass axe. He said, ""I just center the subject as best I can and lop off whatever hangs over on either end.""  ""Ah,"" I said, swallowing hard. ""Sensible.""  ""I'm so glad to come across an intelligent customer!""  The ropes were really stretching my friends now. Annabeth was turning pale. Grover made gurgling sounds, like a strangled goose.  ""So, Crusty ..."" I said, trying to keep my voice light. I glanced at the sales tag on the valentine-shaped Honeymoon Special. ""Does this one really have dynamic stabilizers to stop wave motion?""  ""Absolutely. Try it out.""  ""Yeah, maybe I will. But would it work even for a big guy like you? No waves at all?""  ""Guaranteed.""  ""No way.""  ""Way.""  ""Show me.""  He sat down eagerly on the bed, patted the mattress. ""No waves. See?""  I snapped my fingers. ""Ergo.""  Ropes lashed around Crusty and flattened him against the mattress.  ""Hey!"" he yelled.  ""Center him just right,"" I said.  The ropes readjusted themselves at my command. Crusty's whole head stuck out the top. His feet stuck out the bottom.  ""No!"" he said. ""Wait! This is just a demo.""  I uncapped Riptide. ""A few simple adjustments ...""  I had no qualms about what I was about to do. If Crusty were human, I couldn't hurt him anyway. If he was a monster, he deserved to turn into dust for a while.  ""You drive a hard bargain,"" he told me. ""I'll give you thirty percent off on selected floor models.'""  ""I think I'll start with the top."" I raised my sword.  ""No money down! No interest for six months!""  I swung the sword. Crusty stopped making offers.  I cut the ropes on the other beds. Annabeth and Grover got to their feet, groaning and wincing and cursing me a lot.  ""You look taller,"" I said.  ""Very funny,"" Annabeth said. ""Be faster next time."" I looked at the bulletin board behind Crusty's sales desk. There was an advertisement for Hermes Delivery Service, and another for the All-New Compendium of L.A. Area Monsters—""The only Monstrous Yellow Pages you'll ever need!"" Under that, a bright orange flier for DOA Recording Studios, offering commissions for heroes' souls. ""We are always looking for new talent!"" DOA's address was right underneath with a map.  ""Come on,"" I told my friends.  ""Give us a minute,"" Grover complained. ""We were almost stretched to death.'""  ""Then you're ready for the Underworld,"" I said. ""It's only a block from here."""
Percy Jackson 1 Chapter 18,"We stood in the shadows of Valencia Boulevard, looking up at gold letters etched in black marble: DOA RECORDING STUDIOS.  Underneath, stenciled on the glass doors: NO SOLICITORS. NO LOITERING. NO LIVING.  It was almost midnight, but the lobby was brightly lit and full of people. Behind the security desk sat a tough-looking guard with sunglasses and an earpiece.  I turned to my friends. ""Okay. You remember the plan.""  ""The plan,"" Grover gulped. ""Yeah. I love the plan.""  Annabeth said, ""What happens if the plan doesn't work?""  ""Don't think negative.""  ""Right,"" she said. ""We're entering the Land of the Dead, and I shouldn't think negative.""  I took the pearls out of my pocket, the three milky spheres the Nereid had given me in Santa Monica. They didn't seem like much of a backup in case something went wrong.  Annabeth put her hand on my shoulder. ""I'm sorry, Percy. You're right, we'll make it. It'll be fine.""  She gave Grover a nudge.  ""Oh, right!"" he chimed in. ""We got this far. We'll find the master bolt and save your mom. No problem.""  I looked at them both, and felt really grateful. Only a few minutes before, I'd almost gotten them stretched to death on deluxe water beds, and now they were trying to be brave for my sake, trying to make me feel better.  I slipped the pearls back in my pocket. ""Let's whup some Underworld butt.""  We walked inside the DOA lobby.  Muzak played softly on hidden speakers. The carpet and walls were steel gray. Pencil cactuses grew in the corners like skeleton hands. The furniture was black leather, and every seat was taken. There were people sitting on couches, people standing up, people staring out the windows or waiting for the elevator. Nobody moved, or talked, or did much of anything. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see them all just fine, but if I focused on any one of them in particular, they started looking ... transparent. I could see right through their bodies.  The security guard's desk was a raised podium, so we had to look up at him.  He was tall and elegant, with chocolate-colored skin and bleached-blond hair shaved military style. He wore tortoiseshell shades and a silk Italian suit that matched his hair. A black rose was pinned to his lapel under a silver name tag.  I read the name tag, then looked at him in bewilderment. ""Your name is Chiron?""  He leaned across the desk. I couldn't see anything in his glasses except my own reflection, but his smile was sweet and cold, like a pythons, right before it eats you.  ""What a precious young lad."" He had a strange accent—British, maybe, but also as if he had learned English as a second language. ""Tell me, mate, do I look like a centaur?""  ""N-no.""  ""Sir,"" he added smoothly.  ""Sir,"" I said.  He pinched the name tag and ran his finger under the letters. ""Can you read this, mate? It says C-H-A-R-O-N. Say it with me: CARE-ON.""  ""Charon.""  ""Amazing! Now: Mr. Charon.""  ""Mr. Charon,"" I said.  ""Well done."" He sat back. ""I hate being confused with that old horse-man. And now, how may I help you little dead ones?""  His question caught in my stomach like a fastball. I looked at Annabeth for support.  ""We want to go the Underworld,"" she said.  Charon's mouth twitched. ""Well, that's refreshing.""  ""It is?"" she asked.  ""Straightforward and honest. No screaming. No 'There must be a mistake, Mr. Charon.'"" He looked us over. ""How did you die, then?""  I nudged Grover.  ""Oh,"" he said. ""Um ... drowned ... in the bathtub.""  ""All three of you?"" Charon asked. We nodded.  ""Big bathtub."" Charon looked mildly impressed. ""I don't suppose you have coins for passage. Normally, with adults, you see, I could charge your American Express, or add the ferry price to your last cable bill. But with children ... alas, you never die prepared. Suppose you'll have to take a seat for a few centuries.""  ""Oh, but we have coins."" I set three golden drachmas on the counter, part of the stash I'd found in Crusty's office desk.  ""Well, now ..."" Charon moistened his lips. ""Real drachmas. Real golden drachmas. I haven't seen these in ...""  His fingers hovered greedily over the coins.  We were so close.  Then Charon looked at me. That cold stare behind his glasses seemed to bore a hole through my chest. ""Here now,"" he said. ""You couldn't read my name correctly. Are you dyslexic, lad?""  ""No,"" I said. ""I'm dead.""  Charon leaned forward and took a sniff. ""You're not dead. I should've known. You're a godling.""  ""We have to get to the Underworld,"" I insisted.  Charon made a growling sound deep in his throat.  Immediately, all the people in the waiting room got up and started pacing, agitated, lighting cigarettes, running hands through their hair, or checking their wristwatches.  ""Leave while you can,"" Charon told us. ""I'll just take these and forget I saw you.""  He started to go for the coins, but I snatched them back.  ""No service, no tip."" I tried to sound braver than I felt.  Charon growled again—a deep, blood-chilling sound. The spirits of the dead started pounding on the elevator doors.  ""It's a shame, too,"" I sighed. ""We had more to offer.""  I held up the entire bag from Crusty's stash. I took out a fistful of drachmas and let the coins spill through my fingers.  Charon's growl changed into something more like a lion's purr. ""Do you think I can be bought, godling? Eh ... just out of curiosity, how much have you got there?""  ""A lot,"" I said. ""I bet Hades doesn't pay you well enough for such hard work.""  ""Oh, you don't know the half of it. How would you like to babysit these spirits all day? Always 'Please don't let me be dead' or 'Please let me across for free.' I haven't had a pay raise in three thousand years. Do you imagine suits like this come cheap?""  ""You deserve better,"" I agreed. ""A little appreciation. Respect. Good pay.""  With each word, I stacked another gold coin on the counter.  Charon glanced down at his silk Italian jacket, as if imagining himself in something even better. ""I must say, lad, you're making some sense now. Just a little.""  I stacked another few coins. ""I could mention a pay raise while I'm talking to Hades.""  He sighed. ""The boat's almost full, anyway. I might as well add you three and be off.""  He stood, scooped up our money, and said, ""Come along.""  We pushed through the crowd of waiting spirits, who started grabbing at our clothes like the wind, their voices whispering things I couldn't make out. Charon shoved them out of the way, grumbling, ""Freeloaders.""  He escorted us into the elevator, which was already crowded with souls of the dead, each one holding a green boarding pass. Charon grabbed two spirits who were trying to get on with us and pushed them back into the lobby.  ""Right. Now, no one get any ideas while I'm gone,"" he announced to the waiting room. ""And if anyone moves the dial off my easy-listening station again, I'll make sure you're here for another thousand years. Understand?""  He shut the doors. He put a key card into a slot in the elevator panel and we started to descend.  ""What happens to the spirits waiting in the lobby?"" Annabeth asked.  ""Nothing,"" Charon said.  ""For how long?""  ""Forever, or until I'm feeling generous.""  ""Oh,"" she said. ""That's ... fair.""  Charon raised an eyebrow. ""Whoever said death was fair, young miss? Wait until it's your turn. You'll die soon enough, where you're going.""  ""We'll get out alive,"" I said.  ""Ha.""  I got a sudden dizzy feeling. We weren't going down anymore, but forward. The air turned misty. Spirits around me started changing shape. Their modern clothes flickered, turning into gray hooded robes. The floor of the elevator began swaying.  I blinked hard. When I opened my eyes, Charon's creamy Italian suit had been replaced by a long black robe. His tortoiseshell glasses were gone. Where his eyes should've been were empty sockets—like Ares's eyes, except Charon's were totally dark, full of night and death and despair.  He saw me looking, and said, ""Well?""  ""Nothing,"" I managed.  I thought he was grinning, but that wasn't it. The flesh of his face was becoming transparent, letting me see straight through to his skull.  The floor kept swaying.  Grover said, ""I think I'm getting seasick.""  When I blinked again, the elevator wasn't an elevator anymore. We were standing in a wooden barge. Charon was poling us across a dark, oily river, swirling with bones, dead fish, and other, stranger things—plastic dolls, crushed carnations, soggy diplomas with gilt edges.  ""The River Styx,"" Annabeth murmured. ""It's so ...""  ""Polluted,"" Charon said. ""For thousands of years, you humans have been throwing in everything as you come across—hopes, dreams, wishes that never came true. Irresponsible waste management, if you ask me.""  Mist curled off the filthy water. Above us, almost lost in the gloom, was a ceiling of stalactites. Ahead, the far shore glimmered with greenish light, the color of poison.  Panic closed up my throat. What was I doing here? These people around me ... they were dead.  Annabeth grabbed hold of my hand. Under normal circumstances, this would've embarrassed me, but I understood how she felt. She wanted reassurance that somebody else was alive on this boat.  I found myself muttering a prayer, though I wasn't quite sure who I was praying to. Down here, only one god mattered, and he was the one I had come to confront.  The shoreline of the Underworld came into view. Craggy rocks and black volcanic sand stretched inland about a hundred yards to the base of a high stone wall, which marched off in either direction as far as we could see. A sound came from somewhere nearby in the green gloom, echoing off the stones—the howl of a large animal.  ""Old Three-Face is hungry,"" Charon said. His smile turned skeletal in the greenish light. ""Bad luck for you, godlings.""  The bottom of our boat slid onto the black sand. The dead began to disembark. A woman holding a little girl's hand. An old man and an old woman hobbling along arm in arm. A boy no older than I was, shuffling silently along in his gray robe.  Charon said, ""I'd wish you luck, mate, but there isn't any down here. Mind you, don't forget to mention my pay raise."" He counted our golden coins into his pouch, then took up his pole. He warbled something that sounded like a Barry Manilow song as he ferried the empty barge back across the river.  We followed the spirits up a well-worn path.  I'm not sure what I was expecting—Pearly Gates, or a big black portcullis, or something. But the entrance to the Underworld looked like a cross between airport security and the Jersey Turnpike.  There were three separate entrances under one huge black archway that said YOU ARE NOW ENTERING EREBUS. Each entrance had a pass-through metal detector with security cameras mounted on top. Beyond this were tollbooths manned by black-robed ghouls like Charon.  The howling of the hungry animal was really loud now, but I couldn't see where it was coming from. The three-headed dog, Cerberus, who was supposed to guard Hades's door, was nowhere to be seen.  The dead queued up in the three lines, two marked ATTENDANT ON DUTY, and one marked EZ DEATH. The EZ DEATH line was moving right along. The other two were crawling.  ""What do you figure?"" I asked Annabeth.  ""The fast line must go straight to the Asphodel Fields,"" she said. ""No contest. They don't want to risk judgment from the court, because it might go against them.""  ""There's a court for dead people?""  ""Yeah. Three judges. They switch around who sits on the bench. King Minos, Thomas Jefferson, Shakespeare—people like that. Sometimes they look at a life and decide that person needs a special reward—the Fields of Elysium. Sometimes they decide on punishment. But most people, well, they just lived. Nothing special, good or bad. So they go to the Asphodel Fields.""  ""And do what?""  Grover said, ""Imagine standing in a wheat field in Kansas. Forever.""  ""Harsh,"" I said.  ""Not as harsh as that,"" Grover muttered. ""Look.""  A couple of black-robbed ghouls had pulled aside one spirit and were frisking him at the security desk. The face of the dead man looked vaguely familiar.  ""He's that preacher who made the news, remember?"" Grover asked.  ""Oh, yeah."" I did remember now. We'd seen him on TV a couple of times at the YancyAcademy dorm. He was this annoying televangelist from upstate New York who'd raised millions of dollars for orphanages and then got caught spending the money on stuff for his mansion, like gold-plated toilet seats, and an indoor putt-putt golf course. He'd died in a police chase when his ""Lamborghini for the Lord"" went off a cliff.  I said, ""What're they doing to him?""  ""Special punishment from Hades,"" Grover guessed. ""The really bad people get his personal attention as soon as they arrive. The Fur—the Kindly Ones will set up an eternal torture for him.""  The thought of the Furies made me shudder. I realized I was in their home territory now. Old Mrs. Dodds would be licking her lips with anticipation.  ""But if he's a preacher,"" I said, ""and he believes in a different hell... .""  Grover shrugged. ""Who says he's seeing this place the way we're seeing it? Humans see what they want to see. You're very stubborn—er, persistent, that way.""  We got closer to the gates. The howling was so loud now it shook the ground at my feet, but I still couldn't figure out where it was coming from.  Then, about fifty feet in front of us, the green mist shimmered. Standing just where the path split into three lanes was an enormous shadowy monster.  I hadn't seen it before because it was half transparent, like the dead. Until it moved, it blended with whatever was behind it. Only its eyes and teeth looked solid. And it was staring straight at me.  My jaw hung open. All I could think to say was, ""He's a Rottweiler.""  I'd always imagined Cerberus as a big black mastiff. But he was obviously a purebred Rottweiler, except of course that he was twice the size of a woolly mammoth, mostly invisible, and had three heads.  The dead walked right up to him—no fear at all. The ATTENDANT ON DUTY lines parted on either side of him. The EZ DEATH spirits walked right between his front paws and under his belly, which they could do without even crouching.  ""I'm starting to see him better,"" I muttered. ""Why is that?""  ""I think ..."" Annabeth moistened her lips. ""I'm afraid it's because we're getting closer to being dead.""  The dog's middle head craned toward us. It sniffed the air and growled.  ""It can smell the living,"" I said.  ""But that's okay,"" Grover said, trembling next to me. ""Because we have a plan.""  ""Right,"" Annabeth said. I'd never heard her voice sound quite so small. ""A plan.""  We moved toward the monster.  The middle head snarled at us, then barked so loud my eyeballs rattled.  ""Can you understand it?"" I asked Grover.  ""Oh yeah,"" he said. ""I can understand it.""  ""What's it saying?""  ""I don't think humans have a four-letter word that translates, exactly.""  I took the big stick out of my backpack—a bedpost I'd broken off Crusty's Safari Deluxe floor model. I held it up, and tried to channel happy dog thoughts toward Cerberus—Alpo commercials, cute little puppies, fire hydrants. I tried to smile, like I wasn't about to die.  ""Hey, Big Fella,"" I called up. ""I bet they don't play with you much.""  ""GROWWWLLLL!""  ""Good boy,"" I said weakly.  I waved the stick. The dog's middle head followed the movement. The other two heads trained their eyes on me, completely ignoring the spirits. I had Cerberus's undivided attention. I wasn't sure that was a good thing.  ""Fetch!"" I threw the stick into the gloom, a good solid throw. I heard it go ker-sploosh in the River Styx.  Cerberus glared at me, unimpressed. His eyes were baleful and cold.  So much for the plan.  Cerberus was now making a new kind of growl, deeper down in his three throats.  ""Um,"" Grover said. ""Percy?""  ""Yeah?""  ""I just thought you'd want to know.""  ""Yeah?""  ""Cerberus? He's saying we've got ten seconds to pray to the god of our choice. After that... well ... he's hungry.""  ""Wait!"" Annabeth said. She started rifling through her pack.  Uh-oh, I thought.  ""Five seconds,"" Grover said. ""Do we run now?""  Annabeth produced a red rubber ball the size of a grapefruit. It was labeled WATERLAND, DENVER, CO. Before I could stop her, she raised the ball and marched straight up to Cerberus.  She shouted, ""See the ball? You want the ball, Cerberus? Sit!""  Cerberus looked as stunned as we were.  All three of his heads cocked sideways. Six nostrils dilated.  ""Sit!"" Annabeth called again.  I was sure that any moment she would become the world's largest Milkbone dog biscuit.  But instead, Cerberus licked his three sets of lips, shifted on his haunches, and sat, immediately crushing a dozen spirits who'd been passing underneath him in the EZ DEATH line. The spirits made muffled hisses as they dissipated, like the air let out of tires.  Annabeth said, ""Good boy!""  She threw Cerberus the ball.  He caught it in his middle mouth. It was barely big enough for him to chew, and the other heads started snapping at the middle, trying to get the new toy.  ""Drop it.'"" Annabeth ordered.  Cerberus's heads stopped fighting and looked at her. The ball was wedged between two of his teeth like a tiny piece of gum. He made a loud, scary whimper, then dropped the ball, now slimy and bitten nearly in half, at Annabeth's feet.  ""Good boy."" She picked up the ball, ignoring the monster spit all over it.  She turned toward us. ""Go now. EZ DEATH line—it's faster.""  I said, ""But—""  ""Now.'"" She ordered, in the same tone she was using on the dog.  Grover and I inched forward warily.  Cerberus started to growl.  ""Stay!"" Annabeth ordered the monster. ""If you want the ball, stay!""  Cerberus whimpered, but he stayed where he was.  ""What about you?"" I asked Annabeth as we passed her.  ""I know what I'm doing, Percy,"" she muttered. ""At least, I'm pretty sure... .""  Grover and I walked between the monster's legs.  Please, Annabeth, I prayed. Don't tell him to sit again.  We made it through. Cerberus wasn't any less scary-looking from the back.  Annabeth said, ""Good dog!""  She held up the tattered red ball, and probably came to the same conclusion I did—if she rewarded Cerberus, there'd be nothing left for another trick.  She threw the ball anyway. The monster's left mouth immediately snatched it up, only to be attacked by the middle head, while the right head moaned in protest.  While the monster was distracted, Annabeth walked briskly under its belly and joined us at the metal detector.  ""How did you do that?"" I asked her, amazed.  ""Obedience school,"" she said breathlessly, and I was surprised to see there were tears in her eyes. ""When I was little, at my dad's house, we had a Doberman... .""  ""Never mind that,"" Grover said, tugging at my shirt. ""Come on!""  We were about to bolt through the EZ DEATH line when Cerberus moaned pitifully from all three mouths. Annabeth stopped.  She turned to face the dog, which had done a one-eighty to look at us.  Cerberus panted expectantly, the tiny red ball in pieces in a puddle of drool at its feet.  ""Good boy,"" Annabeth said, but her voice sounded melancholy and uncertain.  The monster's heads turned sideways, as if worried about her.  ""I'll bring you another ball soon,"" Annabeth promised faintly. ""Would you like that?""  The monster whimpered. I didn't need to speak dog to know Cerberus was still waiting for the ball.  ""Good dog. I'll come visit you soon. I—I promise."" Annabeth turned to us. ""Let's go.""  Grover and I pushed through the metal detector, which immediately screamed and set off flashing red lights. ""Unauthorized possessions! Magic detected!""  Cerberus started to bark.  We burst through the EZ DEATH gate, which started even more alarms blaring, and raced into the Underworld.  A few minutes later, we were hiding, out of breath, in the rotten trunk of an immense black tree as security ghouls scuttled past, yelling for backup from the Furies.  Grover murmured, ""Well, Percy, what have we learned today?""  ""That three-headed dogs prefer red rubber balls over sticks?""  ""No,"" Grover told me. ""We've learned that your plans really, really bite!""  I wasn't sure about that. I thought maybe Annabeth and I had both had the right idea. Even here in the Underworld, everybody—even monsters—needed a little attention once in a while.  I thought about that as we waited for the ghouls to pass. I pretended not to see Annabeth wipe a tear from her cheek as she listened to the mournful keening of Cerberus in the distance, longing for his new friend."
Percy Jackson 1 Chapter 19,"Imagine the largest concert crowd you've ever seen, a football field packed with a million fans.  Now imagine a field a million times that big, packed with people, and imagine the electricity has gone out, and there is no noise, no light, no beach ball bouncing around over the crowd. Something tragic has happened backstage. Whispering masses of people are just milling around in the shadows, waiting for a concert that will never start. If you can picture that, you have a pretty good idea what the Fields of Asphodel looked like. The black grass had been trampled by eons of dead feet. A warm, moist wind blew like the breath of a swamp. Black trees—Grover told me they were poplars—grew in clumps here and there.  The cavern ceiling was so high above us it might've been a bank of storm clouds, except for the stalactites, which glowed faint gray and looked wickedly pointed. I tried not to imagine they'd fall on us at any moment, but dotted around the fields were several that had fallen and impaled themselves in the black grass. I guess the dead didn't have to worry about little hazards like being speared by stalactites the size of booster rockets.  Annabeth, Grover, and I tried to blend into the crowd, keeping an eye out for security ghouls. I couldn't help looking for familiar faces among the spirits of Asphodel, but the dead are hard to look at. Their faces shimmer. They all look slightly angry or confused. They will come up to you and speak, but their voices sound like chatter, like bats twittering. Once they realize you can't understand them, they frown and move away.  The dead aren't scary. They're just sad.  We crept along, following the line of new arrivals that snaked from the main gates toward a black-tented pavilion with a banner that read:  JUDGMENTS FOR ELYSIUM AND ETERNAL DAMNATION  Welcome, Newly Deceased!  Out the back of the tent came two much smaller lines.  To the left, spirits flanked by security ghouls were marched down a rocky path toward the Fields of Punishment, which glowed and smoked in the distance, a vast, cracked wasteland with rivers of lava and minefields and miles of barbed wire separating the different torture areas. Even from far away, I could see people being chased by hellhounds, burned at the stake, forced to run naked through cactus patches or listen to opera music. I could just make out a tiny hill, with the ant-size figure of Sisyphus struggling to move his boulder to the top. And I saw worse tortures, too—things I don't want to describe.  The line coming from the right side of the judgment pavilion was much better. This one led down toward a small valley surrounded by walls—a gated community, which seemed to be the only happy part of the Underworld. Beyond the security gate were neighborhoods of beautiful houses from every time period in history, Roman villas and medieval castles and Victorian mansions. Silver and gold flowers bloomed on the lawns. The grass rippled in rainbow colors. I could hear laughter and smell barbecue cooking.  Elysium.  In the middle of that valley was a glittering blue lake, with three small islands like a vacation resort in the Bahamas. The Isles of the Blest, for people who had chosen to be reborn three times, and three times achieved Elysium. Immediately I knew that's where I wanted to go when I died.  ""That's what it's all about,"" Annabeth said, like she was reading my thoughts. ""That's the place for heroes.""  But I thought of how few people there were in Elysium, how tiny it was compared to the Fields of Asphodel or even the Fields of Punishment. So few people did good in their lives. It was depressing.  We left the judgment pavilion and moved deeper into the Asphodel Fields. It got darker. The colors faded from our clothes. The crowds of chattering spirits began to thin.  After a few miles of walking, we began to hear a familiar screech in the distance. Looming on the horizon was a palace of glittering black obsidian. Above the parapets swirled three dark batlike creatures: the Furies. I got the feeling they were waiting for us.  ""I suppose it's too late to turn back,"" Grover said wistfully.  ""We'll be okay."" I tried to sound confident.  ""Maybe we should search some of the other places first,"" Grover suggested. ""Like, Elysium, for instance ...""  ""Come on, goat boy."" Annabeth grabbed his arm.  Grover yelped. His sneakers sprouted wings and his legs shot forward, pulling him away from Annabeth. He landed flat on his back in the grass.  ""Grover,"" Annabeth chided. ""Stop messing around.""  ""But I didn't—""  He yelped again. His shoes were flapping like crazy now. They levitated off the ground and started dragging him away from us.  ""Maia!"" he yelled, but the magic word seemed to have no effect. ""Maia, already! Nine-one-one! Help!""  I got over being stunned and made a grab for Grover's hand, but too late. He was picking up speed, skidding downhill like a bobsled.  We ran after him.  Annabeth shouted, ""Untie the shoes!""  It was a smart idea, but I guess it's not so easy when your shoes are pulling you along feetfirst at full speed. Grover tried to sit up, but he couldn't get close to the laces.  We kept after him, trying to keep him in sight as he ripped between the legs of spirits who chattered at him in annoyance.  I was sure Grover was going to barrel straight through the gates of Hades's palace, but his shoes veered sharply to the right and dragged him in the opposite direction.  The slope got steeper. Grover picked up speed. Annabeth and I had to sprint to keep up. The cavern walls narrowed on either side, and I realized we'd entered some kind of side tunnel. No black grass or trees now, just rock underfoot, and the dim light of the stalactites above.  ""Grover!"" I yelled, my voice echoing. ""Hold on to something!""  ""What?"" he yelled back.  He was grabbing at gravel, but there was nothing big enough to slow him down.  The tunnel got darker and colder. The hairs on my arms bristled. It smelled evil down here. It made me think of things I shouldn't even know about—blood spilled on an ancient stone altar, the foul breath of a murderer.  Then I saw what was ahead of us, and I stopped dead in my tracks.  The tunnel widened into a huge dark cavern, and in the middle was a chasm the size of a city block.  Grover was sliding straight toward the edge.  ""Come on, Percy!"" Annabeth yelled, tugging at my wrist.  ""But that's—""  ""I know!"" she shouted. ""The place you described in your dream! But Grover's going to fall if we don't catch him."" She was right, of course. Grover's predicament got me moving again.  He was yelling, clawing at the ground, but the winged shoes kept dragging him toward the pit, and it didn't look like we could possibly get to him in time.  What saved him were his hooves.  The flying sneakers had always been a loose fit on him, and finally Grover hit a big rock and the left shoe came flying off. It sped into the darkness, down into the chasm. The right shoe kept tugging him along, but not as fast. Grover was able to slow himself down by grabbing on to the big rock and using it like an anchor.  He was ten feet from the edge of the pit when we caught him and hauled him back up the slope. The other winged shoe tugged itself off, circled around us angrily and kicked our heads in protest before flying off into the chasm to join its twin.  We all collapsed, exhausted, on the obsidian gravel. My limbs felt like lead. Even my backpack seemed heavier, as if somebody had filled it with rocks.  Grover was scratched up pretty bad. His hands were bleeding. His eyes had gone slit-pupiled, goat style, the way they did whenever he was terrified.  ""I don't know how ..."" he panted. ""I didn't...""  ""Wait,"" I said. ""Listen.""  I heard something—a deep whisper in the darkness.  Another few seconds, and Annabeth said, ""Percy, this place—""  ""Shh."" I stood.  The sound was getting louder, a muttering, evil voice from far, far below us. Coming from the pit.  Grover sat up. ""Wh—what's that noise?""  Annabeth heard it too, now. I could see it in her eyes. ""Tartarus. The entrance to Tartarus."" I uncapped Anaklusmos.  The bronze sword expanded, gleaming in the darkness, and the evil voice seemed to falter, just for a moment, before resuming its chant.  I could almost make out words now, ancient, ancient words, older even than Greek. As if ...  ""Magic,"" I said.  ""We have to get out of here,"" Annabeth said.  Together, we dragged Grover to his hooves and started back up the tunnel. My legs wouldn't move fast enough. My backpack weighed me down. The voice got louder and angrier behind us, and we broke into a run.  Not a moment too soon.  A cold blast of wind pulled at our backs, as if the entire pit were inhaling. For a terrifying moment, I lost ground, my feet slipping in the gravel. If we'd been any closer to the edge, we would've been sucked in.  We kept struggling forward, and finally reached the top of the tunnel, where the cavern widened out into the Fields of Asphodel. The wind died. A wail of outrage echoed from deep in the tunnel. Something was not happy we'd gotten away.  ""What was that?"" Grover panted, when we'd collapsed in the relative safety of a black poplar grove. ""One of Hades's pets?""  Annabeth and I looked at each other. I could tell she was nursing an idea, probably the same one she'd gotten during the taxi ride to L.A., but she was too scared to share it. That was enough to terrify me.  I capped my sword, put the pen back in my pocket. ""Let's keep going."" I looked at Grover. ""Can you walk?""  He swallowed. ""Yeah, sure. I never liked those shoes, anyway.""  He tried to sound brave about it, but he was trembling as badly as Annabeth and I were. Whatever was in that pit was nobody's pet. It was unspeakably old and powerful. Even Echidna hadn't given me that feeling. I was almost relieved to turn my back on that tunnel and head toward the palace of Hades.  Almost.  The Furies circled the parapets, high in the gloom. The outer walls of the fortress glittered black, and the two-story-tall bronze gates stood wide open.  Up close, I saw that the engravings on the gates were scenes of death. Some were from modern times—an atomic bomb exploding over a city, a trench filled with gas mask-wearing soldiers, a line of African famine victims waiting with empty bowls—but all of them looked as if they'd been etched into the bronze thousands of years ago. I wondered if I was looking at prophecies that had come true.  Inside the courtyard was the strangest garden I'd ever seen. Multicolored mushrooms, poisonous shrubs, and weird luminous plants grew without sunlight. Precious jewels made up for the lack of flowers, piles of rubies as big as my fist, clumps of raw diamonds. Standing here and there like frozen party guests were Medusa's garden statues— petrified children, satyrs, and centaurs—all smiling grotesquely.  In the center of the garden was an orchard of pomegranate trees, their orange blooms neon bright in the dark. ""The garden of Persephone,"" Annabeth said. ""Keep walking.""  I understood why she wanted to move on. The tart smell of those pomegranates was almost overwhelming. I had a sudden desire to eat them, but then I remembered the story of Persephone. One bite of Underworld food, and we would never be able to leave. I pulled Grover away to keep him from picking a big juicy one.  We walked up the steps of the palace, between black columns, through a black marble portico, and into the house of Hades. The entry hall had a polished bronze floor, which seemed to boil in the reflected torchlight. There was no ceiling, just the cavern roof, far above. I guess they never had to worry about rain down here.  Every side doorway was guarded by a skeleton in military gear. Some wore Greek armor, some British redcoat uniforms, some camouflage with tattered American flags on the shoulders. They carried spears or muskets or M-16s. None of them bothered us, but their hollow eye sockets followed us as we walked down the hall, toward the big set of doors at the opposite end. Two U.S. Marine skeletons guarded the doors. They grinned down at us, rocket-propelled grenade launchers held across their chests.  ""You know,"" Grover mumbled, ""I bet Hades doesn't have trouble with door-to-door salesmen.""  My backpack weighed a ton now. I couldn't figure out why. I wanted to open it, check to see if I had somehow picked up a stray bowling ball, but this wasn't the time.  ""Well, guys,"" I said. ""I suppose we should ... knock?""  A hot wind blew down the corridor, and the doors swung open. The guards stepped aside.  ""I guess that means entrez-vous,"" Annabeth said.  The room inside looked just like in my dream, except this time the throne of Hades was occupied.  He was the third god I'd met, but the first who really struck me as godlike.  He was at least ten feet tall, for one thing, and dressed in black silk robes and a crown of braided gold. His skin was albino white, his hair shoulder-length and jet black. He wasn't bulked up like Ares, but he radiated power. He lounged on his throne of fused human bones, looking lithe, graceful, and dangerous as a panther.  I immediately felt like he should be giving the orders. He knew more than I did. He should be my master. Then I told myself to snap out of it.  Hades's aura was affecting me, just as Ares's had. The Lord of the Dead resembled pictures I'd seen of Adolph Hitler, or Napoleon, or the terrorist leaders who direct suicide bombers. Hades had the same intense eyes, the same kind of mesmerizing, evil charisma.  ""You are brave to come here, Son of Poseidon,"" he said in an oily voice. ""After what you have done to me, very brave indeed. Or perhaps you are simply very foolish.""  Numbness crept into my joints, tempting me to lie down and just take a little nap at Hades's feet. Curl up here and sleep forever.  I fought the feeling and stepped forward. I knew what I had to say. ""Lord and Uncle, I come with two requests.""  Hades raised an eyebrow. When he sat forward in his throne, shadowy faces appeared in the folds of his black robes, faces of torment, as if the garment were stitched of trapped souls from the Fields of Punishment, trying to get out. The ADHD part of me wondered, off-task, whether the rest of his clothes were made the same way. What horrible things would you have to do in your life to get woven into Hades's underwear?  ""Only two requests?"" Hades said. ""Arrogant child. As if you have not already taken enough. Speak, then. It amuses me not to strike you dead yet.""  I swallowed. This was going about as well as I'd feared.  I glanced at the empty, smaller throne next to Hades's. It was shaped like a black flower, gilded with gold. I wished Queen Persephone were here. I recalled something in the myths about how she could calm her husband's moods. But it was summer. Of course, Persephone would be above in the world of light with her mother, the goddess of agriculture, Demeter. Her visits, not the tilt of the planet, create the seasons.  Annabeth cleared her throat. Her finger prodded me in the back.  ""Lord Hades,"" I said. ""Look, sir, there can't be a war among the gods. It would be ... bad.""  ""Really bad,"" Grover added helpfully.  ""Return Zeus's master bolt to me,"" I said. ""Please, sir. Let me carry it to Olympus.""  Hades's eyes grew dangerously bright. ""You dare keep up this pretense, after what you have done?""  I glanced back at my friends. They looked as confused as I was.  ""Um ... Uncle,"" I said. ""You keep saying 'after what you've done.' What exactly have I done?""  The throne room shook with a tremor so strong, they probably felt it upstairs in Los Angeles. Debris fell from the cavern ceiling. Doors burst open all along the walls, and skeletal warriors marched in, hundreds of them, from every time period and nation in Western civilization. They lined the perimeter of the room, blocking the exits.  Hades bellowed, ""Do you think I want war, godling?""  I wanted to say, Well, these guys don't look like peace activists. But I thought that might be a dangerous answer.  ""You are the Lord of the Dead,"" I said carefully. ""A war would expand your kingdom, right?""  ""A typical thing for my brothers to say! Do you think I need more subjects? Did you not see the sprawl of the Asphodel Fields?""  ""Well...""  ""Have you any idea how much my kingdom has swollen in this past century alone, how many subdivisions I've had to open?""  I opened my mouth to respond, but Hades was on a roll now.  ""More security ghouls,"" he moaned. ""Traffic problems at the judgment pavilion. Double overtime for the staff. I used to be a rich god, Percy Jackson. I control all the precious metals under the earth. But my expenses!""  ""Charon wants a pay raise,"" I blurted, just remembering the fact. As soon as I said it, I wished I could sew up my mouth.  ""Don't get me started on Charon!"" Hades yelled. ""He's been impossible ever since he discovered Italian suits! Problems everywhere, and I've got to handle all of them personally. The commute time alone from the palace to the gates is enough to drive me insane! And the dead just keep arriving. No, godling. I need no help getting subjects! I did not ask for this war.""  ""But you took Zeus's master bolt.""  ""Lies!"" More rumbling. Hades rose from his throne, towering to the height of a football goalpost. ""Your father may fool Zeus, boy, but I am not so stupid. I see his plan.""  ""His plan?""  ""You were the thief on the winter solstice,"" he said. ""Your father thought to keep you his little secret. He directed you into the throne room on Olympus, You took the master bolt and my helm. Had I not sent my Fury to discover you at YancyAcademy, Poseidon might have succeeded in hiding his scheme to start a war. But now you have been forced into the open. You will be exposed as Poseidon's thief, and I will have my helm back!""  ""But ..."" Annabeth spoke. I could tell her mind was going a million miles an hour. ""Lord Hades, your helm of darkness is missing, too?""  ""Do not play innocent with me, girl. You and the satyr have been helping this hero—coming here to threaten me in Poseidon's name, no doubt—to bring me an ultimatum. Does Poseidon think I can be blackmailed into supporting him?""  ""No!"" I said. ""Poseidon didn't—I didn't—""  ""I have said nothing of the helm's disappearance,"" Hades snarled, ""because I had no illusions that anyone on Olympus would offer me the slightest justice, the slightest help. I can ill afford for word to get out that my most powerful weapon of fear is missing. So I searched for you myself, and when it was clear you were coming to me to deliver your threat, I did not try to stop you.""  ""You didn't try to stop us? But—""  ""Return my helm now, or I will stop death,"" Hades threatened. ""That is my counterproposal. I will open the earth and have the dead pour back into the world. I will make your lands a nightmare. And you, Percy Jackson—your skeleton will lead my army out of Hades.""  The skeletal soldiers all took one step forward, making their weapons ready.  At that point, I probably should have been terrified. The strange thing was, I felt offended. Nothing gets me angrier than being accused of something I didn't do. I've had a lot of experience with that.  ""You're as bad as Zeus,"" I said. ""You think I stole from you? That's why you sent the Furies after me?""  ""Of course,"" Hades said.  ""And the other monsters?""  Hades curled his lip. ""I had nothing to do with them. I wanted no quick death for you—I wanted you brought before me alive so you might face every torture in the Fields of Punishment. Why do you think I let you enter my kingdom so easily?""  ""Easily?""  ""Return my property!""  ""But I don't have your helm. I came for the master bolt.""  ""Which you already possess!"" Hades shouted. ""You came here with it, little fool, thinking you could you threaten me!""  ""But I didn't!""  ""Open your pack, then.""  A horrible feeling struck me. The weight in my backpack, like a bowling ball. It couldn't be....  I slung it off my shoulder and unzipped it. Inside was a two-foot-long metal cylinder, spiked on both ends, humming with energy.  ""Percy,"" Annabeth said. ""How—""  ""I—I don't know. I don't understand.""  ""You heroes are always the same,"" Hades said. ""Your pride makes you foolish, thinking you could bring such a weapon before me. I did not ask for Zeus's master bolt, but since it is here, you will yield it to me. I am sure it will make an excellent bargaining tool. And now ... my helm. Where is it?""  I was speechless. I had no helm. I had no idea how the master bolt had gotten into my backpack. I wanted to think Hades was pulling some kind of trick. Hades was the bad guy. But suddenly the world turned sideways. I realized I'd been played with. Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades had been set at each other's throats by someone else. The master bolt had been in the backpack, and I'd gotten the backpack from ...  ""Lord Hades, wait,"" I said. ""This is all a mistake.""  ""A mistake?"" Hades roared.  The skeletons aimed their weapons. From high above, there was a fluttering of leathery wings, and the three Furies swooped down to perch on the back of their master's throne. The one with Mrs. Dodds's face grinned at me eagerly and flicked her whip.  ""There is no mistake,"" Hades said. ""I know why you have come—I know the real reason you brought the bolt. You came to bargain for her.""  Hades loosed a ball of gold fire from his palm. It exploded on the steps in front of me, and there was my mother, frozen in a shower of gold, just as she was at the moment when the Minotaur began to squeeze her to death.  I couldn't speak. I reached out to touch her, but the light was as hot as a bonfire.  ""Yes,"" Hades said with satisfaction. ""I took her. I knew, Percy Jackson, that you would come to bargain with me eventually. Return my helm, and perhaps I will let her go. She is not dead, you know. Not yet. But if you displease me, that will change.""  I thought about the pearls in my pocket. Maybe they could get me out of this. If I could just get my mom free ...  ""Ah, the pearls,"" Hades said, and my blood froze. ""Yes, my brother and his little tricks. Bring them forth, Percy Jackson.""  My hand moved against my will and brought out the pearls.  ""Only three,"" Hades said. ""What a shame. You do realize each only protects a single person. Try to take your mother, then, little godling. And which of your friends will you leave behind to spend eternity with me? Go on. Choose. Or give me the backpack and accept my terms.""  I looked at Annabeth and Grover. Their faces were grim.  ""We were tricked,"" I told them. ""Set up.""  ""Yes, but why?"" Annabeth asked. ""And the voice in the pit—""  ""I don't know yet,"" I said. ""But I intend to ask.""  ""Decide, boy!"" Hades yelled.  ""Percy."" Grover put his hand on my shoulder. ""You can't give him the bolt,""  ""I know that.""  ""Leave me here,"" he said. ""Use the third pearl on your mom."" ""No!""  ""I'm a satyr,"" Grover said. ""We don't have souls like humans do. He can torture me until I die, but he won't get me forever. I'll just be reincarnated as a flower or something. It's the best way.""  ""No."" Annabeth drew her bronze knife. ""You two go on. Grover, you have to protect Percy. You have to get your searcher's license and start your quest for Pan. Get his mom out of here. I'll cover you. I plan to go down fighting.""  ""No way,"" Grover said. ""I'm staying behind.""  ""Think again, goat boy,"" Annabeth said.  ""Stop it, both of you!"" I felt like my heart was being ripped in two. They had both been with me through so much. I remembered Grover dive-bombing Medusa in the statue garden, and Annabeth saving us from Cerberus; we'd survived Hephaestus's Waterland ride, the St. Louis Arch, the Lotus Casino. I had spent thousands of miles worried that I'd be betrayed by a friend, but these friends would never do that. They had done nothing but save me, over and over, and now they wanted to sacrifice their lives for my mom.  ""I know what to do,"" I said. ""Take these.""  I handed them each a pearl.  Annabeth said, ""But, Percy ...""  I turned and faced my mother. I desperately wanted to sacrifice myself and use the last pearl on her, but I knew what she would say. She would never allow it. I had to get the bolt back to Olympus and tell Zeus the truth. I had to stop the war. She would never forgive me if I saved her instead. I thought about the prophecy made at Half-Blood Hill, what seemed like a million years ago. You will fail to save what matters most in the end.  ""I'm sorry,"" I told her. ""I'll be back. I'll find a way.""  The smug look on Hades's face faded. He said, ""Godling ... ?""  ""I'll find your helm, Uncle,"" I told him. ""I'll return it. Remember about Charon's pay raise.""  ""Do not defy me—""  ""And it wouldn't hurt to play with Cerberus once in a while. He likes red rubber balls.""  ""Percy Jackson, you will not—""  I shouted, ""Now, guys!""  We smashed the pearls at our feet. For a scary moment, nothing happened.  Hades yelled, ""Destroy them!""  The army of skeletons rushed forward, swords out, guns clicking to full automatic. The Furies lunged, their whips bursting into flame.  Just as the skeletons opened fire, the pearl fragments at my feet exploded with a burst of green light and a gust of fresh sea wind. I was encased in a milky white sphere, which was starting to float off the ground.  Annabeth and Grover were right behind me. Spears and bullets sparked harmlessly off the pearl bubbles as we floated up. Hades yelled with such rage, the entire fortress shook and I knew it was not going to be a peaceful night in L.A.  ""Look up.'"" Grover yelled. ""We're going to crash!""  Sure enough, we were racing right toward the stalactites, which I figured would pop our bubbles and skewer us.  ""How do you control these things?"" Annabeth shouted.  ""I don't think you do!"" I shouted back.  We screamed as the bubbles slammed into the ceiling and ... Darkness.  Were we dead?  No, I could still feel the racing sensation. We were going up, right through solid rock as easily as an air bubble in water. That was the power of the pearls, I realized—What belongs to the sea will always return to the sea.  For a few moments, I couldn't see anything outside the smooth walls of my sphere, then my pearl broke through on the ocean floor. The two other milky spheres, Annabeth and Grover, kept pace with me as we soared upward through the water. And—ker-blam!  We exploded on the surface, in the middle of the Santa MonicaBay, knocking a surfer off his board with an indignant, ""Dude!""  I grabbed Grover and hauled him over to a life buoy. I caught Annabeth and dragged her over too. A curious shark was circling us, a great white about eleven feet long.  I said, ""Beat it.""  The shark turned and raced away.  The surfer screamed something about bad mushrooms and paddled away from us as fast as he could.  Somehow, I knew what time it was: early morning, June 21, the day of the summer solstice.  In the distance, Los Angeles was on fire, plumes of smoke rising from neighborhoods all over the city. There had been an earthquake, all right, and it was Hades's fault. He was probably sending an army of the dead after me right now.  But at the moment, the Underworld wasn't my biggest problem.  I had to get to shore. I had to get Zeus's thunderbolt back to Olympus. Most of all, I had to have a serious conversation with the god who'd tricked me."
Percy Jackson 1 Chapter 20,"A Coast Guard boat picked us up, but they were too busy to keep us for long, or to wonder how three kids in street clothes had gotten out into the middle of the bay. There was a disaster to mop up. Their radios were jammed with distress calls.  They dropped us off at the Santa Monica Pier with towels around our shoulders and water bottles that said I'M A JUNIOR COAST GUARD! and sped off to save more people.  Our clothes were sopping wet, even mine. When the Coast Guard boat had appeared, I'd silently prayed they wouldn't pick me out of the water and find me perfectly dry, which might've raised some eyebrows. So I'd willed myself to get soaked. Sure enough, my usual waterproof magic had abandoned me. I was also barefoot, because I'd given my shoes to Grover. Better the Coast Guard wonder why one of us was barefoot than wonder why one of us had hooves.  After reaching dry land, we stumbled down the beach, watching the city burn against a beautiful sunrise. I felt as if I'd just come back from the dead—which I had. My backpack was heavy with Zeus's master bolt. My heart was even heavier from seeing my mother.  ""I don't believe it,"" Annabeth said. ""We went all that way—""  ""It was a trick,"" I said. ""A strategy worthy of Athena.""  ""Hey,"" she warned.  ""You get it, don't you?""  She dropped her eyes, her anger fading. ""Yeah. I get it.""  ""Well, I don't!"" Grover complained. ""Would somebody—""  ""Percy ..."" Annabeth said. ""I'm sorry about your mother. I'm so sorry....""  I pretended not to hear her. If I talked about my mother, I was going to start crying like a little kid.  ""The prophecy was right,"" I said. ""You shall go west and face the god who has turned.' But it wasn't Hades. Hades didn't want war among the Big Three. Someone else pulled off the theft. Someone stole Zeus's master bolt, and Hades's helm, and framed me because I'm Poseidon's kid. Poseidon will get blamed by both sides. By sundown today, there will be a three-way war. And I'll have caused it.""  Grover shook his head, mystified. ""But who would be that sneaky? Who would want war that bad?""  I stopped in my tracks, looking down the beach. ""Gee, let me think.""  There he was, waiting for us, in his black leather duster and his sunglasses, an aluminum baseball bat propped on his shoulder. His motorcycle rumbled beside him, its headlight turning the sand red.  ""Hey, kid,"" Ares said, seeming genuinely pleased to see me. ""You were supposed to die.""  ""You tricked me,"" I said. ""You stole the helm and the master bolt.""  Ares grinned. ""Well, now, I didn't steal them personally. Gods taking each other's symbols of power—that's a big no-no. But you're not the only hero in the world who can run errands.""  ""Who did you use? Clarisse? She was there at the winter solstice.""  The idea seemed to amuse him. ""Doesn't matter. The point is, kid, you're impeding the war effort. See, you've got to die in the Underworld. Then Old Seaweed will be mad at Hades for killing you. Corpse Breath will have Zeus's master bolt, so Zeus'll be mad at him. And Hades is still looking for this ...""  From his pocket he took out a ski cap—the kind bank robbers wear—and placed it between the handlebars of his bike. Immediately, the cap transformed into an elaborate bronze war helmet.  ""The helm of darkness,"" Grover gasped.  ""Exactly,"" Ares said. ""Now where was I? Oh yeah, Hades will be mad at both Zeus and Poseidon, because he doesn't know who took this. Pretty soon, we got a nice little three-way slugfest going."" ""But they're your family!"" Annabeth protested.  Ares shrugged. ""Best kind of war. Always the bloodiest. Nothing like watching your relatives fight, I always say.""  ""You gave me the backpack in Denver,"" I said. ""The master bolt was in there the whole time.""  ""Yes and no,"" Ares said. ""It's probably too complicated for your little mortal brain to follow, but the backpack is the master bolt's sheath, just morphed a bit. The bolt is connected to it, sort of like that sword you got, kid. It always returns to your pocket, right?""  I wasn't sure how Ares knew about that, but I guess a god of war had to make it his business to know about weapons.  ""Anyway,"" Ares continued, ""I tinkered with the magic a bit, so the bolt would only return to the sheath once you reached the Underworld. You get close to Hades.... Bingo, you got mail. If you died along the way—no loss. I still had the weapon.""  ""But why not just keep the master bolt for yourself?"" I said. ""Why send it to Hades?""  Ares got a twitch in his jaw. For a moment, it was almost as if he were listening to another voice, deep inside his head. ""Why didn't I ... yeah ... with that kind of firepower ...""  He held the trance for one second ... two seconds....  I exchanged nervous looks with Annabeth.  Ares's face cleared. ""I didn't want the trouble. Better to have you caught redhanded, holding the thing.""  ""You're lying,"" I said. ""Sending the bolt to the Underworld wasn't your idea, was it?""  ""Of course it was!"" Smoke drifted up from his sunglasses, as if they were about to catch fire.  ""You didn't order the theft,"" I guessed. ""Someone else sent a hero to steal the two items. Then, when Zeus sent you to hunt him down, you caught the thief. But you didn't turn him over to Zeus. Something convinced you to let him go. You kept the items until another hero could come along and complete the delivery. That thing in the pit is ordering you around.""  ""I am the god of war! I take orders from no one! I don't have dreams!""  I hesitated. ""Who said anything about dreams?""  Ares looked agitated, but he tried to cover it with a smirk.  ""Let's get back to the problem at hand, kid. You're alive. I can't have you taking that bolt to Olympus. You just might get those hardheaded idiots to listen to you. So I've got to kill you. Nothing personal.""  He snapped his fingers. The sand exploded at his feet and out charged a wild boar, even larger and uglier than the one whose head hung above the door of cabin seven at CampHalf-Blood. The beast pawed the sand, glaring at me with beady eyes as it lowered its razor-sharp tusks and waited for the command to kill.  I stepped into the surf. ""Fight me yourself, Ares.""  He laughed, but I heard a little edge to his laughter ... an uneasiness. ""You've only got one talent, kid, running away. You ran from the Chimera. You ran from the Underworld. You don't have what it takes."" ""Scared?""  ""In your adolescent dreams."" But his sunglasses were starting to melt from the heat of his eyes. ""No direct involvement. Sorry, kid. You're not at my level.""  Annabeth said, ""Percy, run!""  The giant boar charged.  But I was done running from monsters. Or Hades, or Ares, or anybody.  As the boar rushed me, I uncapped my pen and sidestepped. Riptide appeared in my hands. I slashed upward. The boar's severed right tusk fell at my feet, while the disoriented animal charged into the sea.  I shouted, ""Wave!""  Immediately, a wave surged up from nowhere and engulfed the boar, wrapping around it like a blanket. The beast squealed once in terror. Then it was gone, swallowed by the sea.  I turned back to Ares. ""Are you going to fight me now?"" I asked.  ""Or are you going to hide behind another pet?""  Ares's face was purple with rage. ""Watch it, kid. I could turn you into—""  ""A cockroach,"" I said. ""Or a tapeworm. Yeah, I'm sure. That'd save you from getting your godly hide whipped, wouldn't it?""  Flames danced along the top of his glasses. ""Oh, man, you are really asking to be smashed into a grease spot.""  ""If I lose, turn me into anything you want. Take the bolt. If I win, the helm and the bolt are mine and you have to go away.""  Ares sneered.  He swung the baseball bat off his shoulder. ""How would you like to get smashed: classic or modern?""  I showed him my sword.  ""That's cool, dead boy,"" he said.  ""Classic it is."" The baseball bat changed into a huge, two-handed sword. The hilt was a large silver skull with a ruby in its mouth.  ""Percy,"" Annabeth said. ""Don't do this. He's a god.""  ""He's a coward,"" I told her.  She swallowed. ""Wear this, at least. For luck.""  She took off her necklace, with her five years' worth of camp beads and the ring from her father, and tied it around my neck.  ""Reconciliation,"" she said. ""Athena and Poseidon together.""  My face felt a little warm, but I managed a smile. ""Thanks.""  ""And take this,"" Grover said. He handed me a flattened tin can that he'd probably been saving in his pocket for a thousand miles. ""The satyrs stand behind you.""  ""Grover ... I don't know what to say.""  He patted me on the shoulder. I stuffed the tin can in my back pocket.  ""You all done saying good-bye?"" Ares came toward me, his black leather duster trailing behind him, his sword glinting like fire in the sunrise. ""I've been fighting for eternity, kid. My strength is unlimited and I cannot die. What have you got?""  A smaller ego, I thought, but I said nothing. I kept my feet in the surf, backing into the water up to my ankles. I thought back to what Annabeth had said at the Denver diner, so long ago: Ares has strength. That's all he has. Even strength has to how to wisdom sometimes.  He cleaved downward at my head, but I wasn't there.  My body thought for me. The water seemed to push me into the air and I catapulted over him, slashing as I came down. But Ares was just as quick. He twisted, and the strike that should've caught him directly in the spine was deflected off the end of his sword hilt.  He grinned. ""Not bad, not bad.""  He slashed again and I was forced to jump onto dry land. I tried to sidestep, to get back to the water, but Ares seemed to know what I wanted. He outmaneuvered me, pressing so hard I had to put all my concentration on not getting sliced into pieces. I kept backing away from the surf. I couldn't find any openings to attack. His sword had a reach several feet longer than Anaklusmos.  Get in close, Luke had told me once, back in our sword class. When you've got the shorter blade, get in close.  I stepped inside with a thrust, but Ares was waiting for that. He knocked my blade out of my hands and kicked me in the chest. I went airborne—twenty, maybe thirty feet. I would've broken my back if I hadn't crashed into the soft sand of a dune.  ""Percy!"" Annabeth yelled. ""Cops!""  I was seeing double. My chest felt like it had just been hit with a battering ram, but I managed to get to my feet.  I couldn't look away from Ares for fear he'd slice me in half, but out of the corner of my eye I saw red lights flashing on the shoreline boulevard. Car doors were slamming.  ""There, officer!"" somebody yelled. ""See?""  A gruff cop voice: ""Looks like that kid on TV ... what the heck ...""  ""That guy's armed,"" another cop said. ""Call for backup.""  I rolled to one side as Ares's blade slashed the sand.  I ran for my sword, scooped it up, and launched a swipe at Ares's face, only to find my blade deflected again.  Ares seemed to know exactly what I was going to do the moment before I did it.  I stepped back toward the surf, forcing him to follow.  ""Admit it, kid,"" Ares said. ""You got no hope. I'm just toying with you.""  My senses were working overtime. I now understood what Annabeth had said about ADHD keeping you alive in battle. I was wide awake, noticing every little detail.  I could see where Ares was tensing. I could tell which way he would strike. At the same time, I was aware of Annabeth and Grover, thirty feet to my left. I saw a second cop car pulling up, siren wailing. Spectators, people who had been wandering the streets because of the earthquake, were starting to gather. Among the crowd, I thought I saw a few who were walking with the strange, trotting gait of disguised satyrs. There were shimmering forms of spirits, too, as if the dead had risen from Hades to watch the battle. I heard the flap of leathery wings circling somewhere above.  More sirens.  I stepped farther into the water, but Ares was fast. The tip of his blade ripped my sleeve and grazed my forearm.  A police voice on a megaphone said, ""Drop the guns.' Set them on the ground. Now!""  Guns?  I looked at Ares's weapon, and it seemed to be flickering; sometimes it looked like a shotgun, sometimes a two-handed sword. I didn't know what the humans were seeing in my hands, but I was pretty sure it wouldn't make them like me.  Ares turned to glare at our spectators, which gave me a moment to breathe. There were five police cars now, and a line of officers crouching behind them, pistols trained on us.  ""This is a private matter!"" Ares bellowed. ""Be gone.'""  He swept his hand, and a wall of red flame rolled across the patrol cars. The police barely had time to dive for cover before their vehicles exploded. The crowd behind them scattered, screaming.  Ares roared with laughter. ""Now, little hero. Let's add you to the barbecue.""  He slashed. I deflected his blade. I got close enough to strike, tried to fake him out with a feint, but my blow was knocked aside. The waves were hitting me in the back now. Ares was up to his thighs, wading in after me.  I felt the rhythm of the sea, the waves growing larger as the tide rolled in, and suddenly I had an idea. Little waves, I thought. And the water behind me seemed to recede. I was holding back the tide by force of will, but tension was building, like carbonation behind a cork.  Ares came toward, grinning confidently. I lowered my blade, as if I were too exhausted to go on. Wait for it, I told the sea. The pressure now was almost lifting me off my feet. Ares raised his sword. I released the tide and jumped, rocketing straight over Ares on a wave.  A six-foot wall of water smashed him full in the face, leaving him cursing and sputtering with a mouth full of seaweed. I landed behind him with a splash and feinted toward his head, as I'd done before. He turned in time to raise his sword, but this time he was disoriented, he didn't anticipate the trick. I changed direction, lunged to the side, and stabbed Riptide straight down into the water, sending the point through the god's heel.  The roar that followed made Hades's earthquake look like a minor event. The very sea was blasted back from Ares, leaving a wet circle of sand fifty feet wide.  Ichor, the golden blood of the gods, flowed from a gash in the war god's boot. The expression on his face was beyond hatred. It was pain, shock, complete disbelief that he'd been wounded.  He limped toward me, muttering ancient Greek curses.  Something stopped him.  It was as if a cloud covered the sun, but worse. Light faded. Sound and color drained away. A cold, heavy presence passed over the beach, slowing time, dropping the temperature to freezing, and making me feel like life was hopeless, fighting was useless.  The darkness lifted.  Ares looked stunned.  Police cars were burning behind us. The crowd of spectators had fled. Annabeth and Grover stood on the beach, in shock, watching the water flood back around Ares's feet, his glowing golden ichor dissipating in the tide.  Ares lowered his sword.  ""You have made an enemy, godling,"" he told me. ""You have sealed your fate. Every time you raise your blade in battle, every time you hope for success, you will feel my curse. Beware, Perseus Jackson. Beware.""  His body began to glow.  '''Percy!"" Annabeth shouted. ""Don't watch!""  I turned away as the god Ares revealed his true immortal form. I somehow knew that if I looked, I would disintegrate into ashes.  The light died.  I looked back. Ares was gone. The tide rolled out to reveal Hades's bronze helm of darkness. I picked it up and walked toward my friends.  But before I got there, I heard the flapping of leathery wings. Three evil-looking grandmothers with lace hats and fiery whips drifted down from the sky and landed in front of me.  The middle Fury, the one who had been Mrs. Dodds, stepped forward. Her fangs were bared, but for once she didn't look threatening. She looked more disappointed, as if she'd been planning to have me for supper, but had decided I might give her indigestion.  ""We saw the whole thing,"" she hissed. ""So ... it truly was not you?""  I tossed her the helmet, which she caught in surprise.  ""Return that to Lord Hades,"" I said. ""Tell him the truth. Tell him to call off the war.""  She hesitated, then ran a forked tongue over her green, leathery lips. ""Live well, Percy Jackson. Become a true hero. Because if you do not, if you ever come into my clutches again ...""  She cackled, savoring the idea. Then she and her sisters rose on their bats' wings, fluttered into the smoke-filled sky, and disappeared.  I joined Grover and Annabeth, who were staring at me in amazement.  ""Percy ..."" Grover said. ""That was so incredibly ...""  ""Terrifying,"" said Annabeth.  ""Cool!"" Grover corrected.  I didn't feel terrified. I certainly didn't feel cool. I was tired and sore and completely drained of energy.  ""Did you guys feel that... whatever it was?"" I asked.  They both nodded uneasily.  ""Must've been the Furies overhead,"" Grover said.  But I wasn't so sure. Something had stopped Ares from killing me, and whatever could do that was a lot stronger than the Furies.  I looked at Annabeth, and an understanding passed between us. I knew now what was in that pit, what had spoken from the entrance of Tartarus.  I reclaimed my backpack from Grover and looked inside. The master bolt was still there. Such a small thing to almost cause World War III.  ""We have to get back to New York,"" I said. ""By tonight."" ""That's impossible,"" Annabeth said, ""unless we—""  ""Fly,"" I agreed.  She stared at me. ""Fly, like, in an airplane, which you were warned never to do lest Zeus strike you out of the sky, and carrying a weapon that has more destructive power than a nuclear bomb?""  ""Yeah,"" I said. ""Pretty much exactly like that. Come on."""
Percy Jackson 1 Chapter 21,"It's funny how humans can wrap their mind around things and fit them into their version of reality. Chiron had told me that long ago. As usual, I didn't appreciate his wisdom until much later.  According to the L.A. news, the explosion at the Santa Monica beach had been caused when a crazy kidnapper fired a shotgun at a police car. He accidentally hit a gas main that had ruptured during the earthquake.  This crazy kidnapper (a.k.a. Ares) was the same man who had abducted me and two other adolescents in New York and brought us across country on a ten-day odyssey of terror.  Poor little Percy Jackson wasn't an international criminal after all. He'd caused a commotion on that Greyhound bus in New Jersey trying to get away from his captor (and afterward, witnesses would even swear they had seen the leather-clad man on the bus—""Why didn't I remember him before?""). The crazy man had caused the explosion in the St. Louis Arch. After all, no kid could've done that. A concerned waitress in Denver had seen the man threatening his abductees outside her diner, gotten a friend to take a photo, and notified the police. Finally, brave Percy Jackson (I was beginning to like this kid) had stolen a gun from his captor in Los Angeles and battled him shotgun-to-rifle on the beach. Police had arrived just in time. But in the spectacular explosion, five police cars had been destroyed and the captor had fled. No fatalities had occurred. Percy Jackson and his two friends were safely in police custody.  The reporters fed us this whole story. We just nodded and acted tearful and exhausted (which wasn't hard), and played victimized kids for the cameras.  ""All I want,"" I said, choking back my tears, ""is to see my loving stepfather again. Every time I saw him on TV, calling me a delinquent punk, I knew ... somehow ... we would be okay. And I know he'll want to reward each and every person in this beautiful city of Los Angeles with a free major appliance from his store. Here's the phone number."" The police and reporters were so moved that they passed around the hat and raised money for three tickets on the next plane to New York.  I knew there was no choice but to fly. I hoped Zeus would cut me some slack, considering the circumstances. But it was still hard to force myself on board the flight.  Takeoff was a nightmare. Every spot of turbulence was scarier than a Greek monster. I didn't unclench my hands from the armrests until we touched down safely at La Guardia. The local press was waiting for us outside security, but we managed to evade them thanks to Annabeth, who lured them away in her invisible Yankees cap, shouting, ""They're over by the frozen yogurt! Come on!"" then rejoined us at baggage claim.  We split up at the taxi stand. I told Annabeth and Grover to get back to Half-Blood Hill and let Chiron know what had happened. They protested, and it was hard to let them go after all we'd been through, but I knew I had to do this last part of the quest by myself. If things went wrong, if the gods didn't believe me ... I wanted Annabeth and Grover to survive to tell Chiron the truth.  I hopped in a taxi and headed into Manhattan.  Thirty minutes later, I walked into the lobby of the EmpireStateBuilding.  I must have looked like a homeless kid, with my tattered clothes and my scraped-up face. I hadn't slept in at least twenty-four hours.  I went up to the guard at the front desk and said, ""Six hundredth floor.""  He was reading a huge book with a picture of a wizard on the front. I wasn't much into fantasy, but the book must've been good, because the guard took a while to look up. ""No such floor, kiddo.""  ""I need an audience with Zeus.""  He gave me a vacant smile. ""Sorry?""  ""You heard me.""  I was about to decide this guy was just a regular mortal, and I'd better run for it before he called the straitjacket patrol, when he said, ""No appointment, no audience, kiddo. Lord Zeus doesn't see anyone unannounced.""  ""Oh, I think he'll make an exception."" I slipped off my backpack and unzipped the top.  The guard looked inside at the metal cylinder, not getting what it was for a few seconds. Then his face went pale. ""That isn't...""  ""Yes, it is,"" I promised. ""You want me take it out and—""  ""No! No!"" He scrambled out of his seat, fumbled around his desk for a key card, then handed it to me. ""Insert this in the security slot. Make sure nobody else is in the elevator with you.""  I did as he told me. As soon as the elevator doors closed, I slipped the key into the slot. The card disappeared and a new button appeared on the console, a red one that said 600.  I pressed it and waited, and waited.  Muzak played. ""Raindrops keep falling on my head....""  Finally, ding. The doors slid open. I stepped out and almost had a heart attack.  I was standing on a narrow stone walkway in the middle of the air. Below me was Manhattan, from the height of an airplane. In front of me, white marble steps wound up the spine of a cloud, into the sky. My eyes followed the stairway to its end, where my brain just could not accept what I saw.  Look again, my brain said.  We're looking, my eyes insisted. It's really there.  From the top of the clouds rose the decapitated peak of a mountain, its summit covered with snow. Clinging to the mountainside were dozens of multileveled palaces—a city of mansions—all with white-columned porticos, gilded terraces, and bronze braziers glowing with a thousand fires. Roads wound crazily up to the peak, where the largest palace gleamed against the snow. Precariously perched gardens bloomed with olive trees and rosebushes. I could make out an open-air market filled with colorful tents, a stone amphitheater built on one side of the mountain, a hippodrome and a coliseum on the other. It was an Ancient Greek city, except it wasn't in ruins. It was new, and clean, and colorful, the way Athens must've looked twenty-five hundred years ago.  This place can't be here, I told myself. The tip of a mountain hanging over New York City like a billion-ton asteroid? How could something like that be anchored above the EmpireStateBuilding, in plain sight of millions of people, and not get noticed?  But here it was. And here I was.  My trip through Olympus was a daze. I passed some giggling wood nymphs who threw olives at me from their garden. Hawkers in the market offered to sell me ambrosia-on-a-stick, and a new shield, and a genuine glitter-weave replica of the Golden Fleece, as seen on Hephaestus-TV The nine muses were tuning their instruments for a concert in the park while a small crowd gathered—satyrs and naiads and a bunch of good-looking teenagers who might've been minor gods and goddesses. Nobody seemed worried about an impending civil war. In fact, everybody seemed in a festive mood. Several of them turned to watch me pass, and whispered to themselves.  I climbed the main road, toward the big palace at the peak. It was a reverse copy of the palace in the Underworld.  There, everything had been black and bronze. Here, everything glittered white and silver.  I realized Hades must've built his palace to resemble this one. He wasn't welcomed in Olympus except on the winter solstice, so he'd built his own Olympus underground. Despite my bad experience with him, I felt a little sorry for the guy. To be banished from this place seemed really unfair. It would make anybody bitter.  Steps led up to a central courtyard. Past that, the throne loom.  Room really isn't the right word. The place made Grand Central Station look like a broom closet. Massive columns rose to a domed ceiling, which was gilded with moving constellations.  Twelve thrones, built for beings the size of Hades, were arranged in an inverted U, just like the cabins at CampHalf-Blood. An enormous fire crackled in the central hearth pit. The thrones were empty except for two at the end: the head throne on the right, and the one to its immediate left. I didn't have to be told who the two gods were that were sitting there, waiting for me to approach. I came toward them, my legs trembling.  The gods were in giant human form, as Hades had been, but I could barely look at them without feeling a tingle, as if my body were starting to burn. Zeus, the Lord of the Gods, wore a dark blue pinstriped suit. He sat on a simple throne of solid platinum. He had a well-trimmed beard, marbled gray and black like a storm cloud. His face was proud and handsome and grim, his eyes rainy gray.  As I got nearer to him, the air crackled and smelled of ozone.  The god sitting next to him was his brother, without a doubt, but he was dressed very differently. He reminded me of a beachcomber from Key West. He wore leather sandals, khaki Bermuda shorts, and a Tommy Bahama shirt with coconuts and parrots all over it. His skin was deeply tanned, his hands scarred like an old-time fisherman's. His hair was black, like mine. His face had that same brooding look that had always gotten me branded a rebel. But his eyes, seagreen like mine, were surrounded by sun-crinkles that told me he smiled a lot, too.  His throne was a deep-sea fisherman's chair. It was the simple swiveling kind, with a black leather seat and a built-in holster for a fishing pole. Instead of a pole, the holster held a bronze trident, flickering with green light around the tips.  The gods weren't moving or speaking, but there was tension in the air, as if they'd just finished an argument.  I approached the fisherman's throne and knelt at his feet. ""Father."" I dared not look up. My heart was racing. I could feel the energy emanating from the two gods. If I said the wrong thing, I had no doubt they could blast me into dust.  To my left, Zeus spoke. ""Should you not address the master of this house first, boy?""  I kept my head down, and waited.  ""Peace, brother,"" Poseidon finally said. His voice stirred my oldest memories: that warm glow I remembered as a baby, the sensation of this god's hand on my forehead, ""The boy defers to his father. This is only right.""  ""You still claim him then?"" Zeus asked, menacingly. ""You claim this child whom you sired against our sacred oath?""  ""I have admitted my wrongdoing,"" Poseidon said. ""Now I would hear him speak.""  Wrongdoing.  A lump welled up in my throat. Was that all I was? A wrongdoing? The result of a god's mistake?  ""I have spared him once already,"" Zeus grumbled. ""Daring to fly through my domain ... pah! I should have blasted him out of the sky for his impudence.""  ""And risk destroying your own master bolt?"" Poseidon asked calmly. ""Let us hear him out, brother.""  Zeus grumbled some more. ""I shall listen,"" he decided. ""Then I shall make up my mind whether or not to cast this boy down from Olympus.""  ""Perseus,"" Poseidon said. ""Look at me.""  I did, and I wasn't sure what I saw in his face. There was no clear sign of love or approval. Nothing to encourage me. It was like looking at the ocean: some days, you could tell what mood it was in. Most days, though, it was unreadable, mysterious.  I got the feeling Poseidon really didn't know what to think of me. He didn't know whether he was happy to have me as a son or not. In a strange way, I was glad that Poseidon was so distant. If he'd tried to apologize, or told me he loved me, or even smiled, it would've felt fake. Like a human dad, making some lame excuse for not being around. I could live with that. After all, I wasn't sure about him yet, either. ""Address Lord Zeus, boy,"" Poseidon told me. ""Tell him your story.""  So I told Zeus everything, just as it had happened. I took out the metal cylinder, which began sparking in the Sky God's presence, and laid it at his feet.  There was a long silence, broken only by the crackle of the hearth fire.  Zeus opened his palm. The lightning bolt flew into it. As he closed his fist, the metallic points flared with electricity, until he was holding what looked more like the classic thunderbolt, a twenty-foot javelin of arcing, hissing energy that made the hairs on my scalp rise.  ""I sense the boy tells the truth,"" Zeus muttered. ""But that Ares would do such a thing ... it is most unlike him.""  ""He is proud and impulsive,"" Poseidon said. ""It runs in the family.""  ""Lord?"" I asked.  They both said, ""Yes?""  ""Ares didn't act alone. Someone else—something else— came up with the idea.""  I described my dreams, and the feeling I'd had on the beach, that momentary breath of evil that had seemed to stop the world, and made Ares back off from killing me.  ""In the dreams,"" I said, ""the voice told me to bring the bolt to the Underworld. Ares hinted that he'd been having dreams, too. I think he was being used, just as I was, to start a war.""  ""You are accusing Hades, after all?"" Zeus asked.  ""No,"" I said. ""I mean, Lord Zeus, I've been in the presence of Hades. This feeling on the beach was different. It was the same thing I felt when I got close to that pit. That was the entrance to Tartarus, wasn't it? Something powerful and evil is stirring down there ... something even older than the gods.""  Poseidon and Zeus looked at each other. They had a quick, intense discussion in Ancient Greek. I only caught one word. Father.  Poseidon made some kind of suggestion, but Zeus cut him off. Poseidon tried to argue. Zeus held up his hand angrily. ""We will speak of this no more,"" Zeus said. ""I must go personally to purify this thunderbolt in the waters of Lemnos, to remove the human taint from its metal.""  He rose and looked at me. His expression softened just a fraction of a degree. ""You have done me a service, boy. Few heroes could have accomplished as much.""  ""I had help, sir,"" I said.   ""Grover Underwood and Annabeth Chase—""  ""To show you my thanks, I shall spare your life. I do not trust you, Perseus Jackson. I do not like what your arrival means for the future of Olympus. But for the sake of peace in the family, I shall let you live.""  ""Um ... thank you, sir.""  ""Do not presume to fly again. Do not let me find you here when I return. Otherwise you shall taste this bolt. And it shall be your last sensation.""  Thunder shook the palace. With a blinding flash of lightning, Zeus was gone.  I was alone in the throne room with my father. ""Your uncle,"" Poseidon sighed, ""has always had a flair for dramatic exits. I think he would've done well as the god of theater.""  An uncomfortable silence.  ""Sir,"" I said, ""what was in that pit?""  Poseidon regarded me. ""Have you not guessed?""  ""Kronos,"" I said. ""The king of the Titans.""  Even in the throne room of Olympus, far away from Tartarus, the name Kronos darkened the room, made the hearth fire seem not quite so warm on my back.  Poseidon gripped his trident. ""In the First War, Percy, Zeus cut our father Kronos into a thousand pieces, just as Kronos had done to his own father, Ouranos. Zeus cast Kronos's remains into the darkest pit of Tartarus. The Titan army was scattered, their mountain fortress on Etna destroyed, their monstrous allies driven to the farthest corners of the earth. And yet Titans cannot die, any more than we gods can. Whatever is left of Kronos is still alive in some hideous way, still conscious in his eternal pain, still hungering for power.""  ""He's healing,"" I said. ""He's coming back.""  Poseidon shook his head. ""From time to time, over the eons, Kronos has stirred. He enters men's nightmares and breathes evil thoughts. He wakens restless monsters from the depths. But to suggest he could rise from the pit is another thing.""  ""That's what he intends, Father. That's what he said.""  Poseidon was silent for a long time.  ""Lord Zeus has closed discussion on this matter. He will not allow talk of Kronos. You have completed your quest, child. That is all you need to do.""  ""But—"" I stopped myself. Arguing would do no good. It would very possibly anger the only god who I had on my side. ""As ... as you wish, Father.""  A faint smile played on his lips. ""Obedience does not come naturally to you, does it?""  ""No ... sir.""  ""I must take some blame for that, I suppose. The sea does not like to be restrained."" He rose to his full height and took up his trident. Then he shimmered and became the size of a regular man, standing directly in front of me. ""You must go, child. But first, know that your mother has returned.""  I stared at him, completely stunned. ""My mother?""  ""You will find her at home. Hades sent her when you recovered his helm. Even the Lord of Death pays his debts.""  My heart was pounding. I couldn't believe it. ""Do you ... would you ...""  I wanted to ask if Poseidon would come with me to see her, but then I realized that was ridiculous. I imagined loading the God of the Sea into a taxi and taking him to the Upper East Side. If he'd wanted to see my mom all these years, he would have. And there was Smelly Gabe to think about.  Poseidon's eyes took on a little sadness. ""When you return home, Percy, you must make an important choice. You will find a package waiting in your room.""  ""A package?""  ""You will understand when you see it. No one can choose your path, Percy. You must decide.""  I nodded, though I didn't know what he meant.  ""Your mother is a queen among women,"" Poseidon said wistfully. ""I had not met such a mortal woman in a thousand years. Still ... I am sorry you were born, child. I have brought you a hero's fate, and a hero's fate is never happy. It is never anything but tragic.""  I tried not to feel hurt. Here was my own dad, telling me he was sorry I'd been born. ""I don't mind, Father.""  ""Not yet, perhaps,"" he said. ""Not yet. But it was an unforgivable mistake on my part.""  ""I'll leave you then."" I bowed awkwardly. ""I—I won't bother you again.""  I was five steps away when he called, ""Perseus.""  I turned.  There was a different light in his eyes, a fiery kind of pride. ""You did well, Perseus. Do not misunderstand me. Whatever else you do, know that you are mine. You are a true son of the Sea God.""  As I walked back through the city of the gods, conversations stopped. The muses paused their concert. People and satyrs and naiads all turned toward me, their faces filled with respect and gratitude, and as I passed, they knelt, as if I were some kind of hero.  * * *  Fifteen minutes later, still in a trance, I was back on the streets of Manhattan.  I caught a taxi to my mom's apartment, rang the doorbell, and there she was—my beautiful mother, smelling of peppermint and licorice, the weariness and worry evaporating from her face as soon as she saw me.  ""Percy! Oh, thank goodness. Oh, my baby.""  She crushed the air right out of me. We stood in the hallway as she cried and ran her hands through my hair.  I'll admit it—my eyes were a little misty, too. I was shaking, I was so relieved to see her.  She told me she'd just appeared at the apartment that morning, scaring Gabe half out of his wits. She didn't remember anything since the Minotaur, and couldn't believe it when Gabe told her I was a wanted criminal, traveling across the country, blowing up national monuments. She'd been going out of her mind with worry all day because she hadn't heard the news. Gabe had forced her to go into work, saying she had a month's salary to make up and she'd better get started.  I swallowed back my anger and told her my own story. I tried to make it sound less scary than it had been, but that wasn't easy. I was just getting to the fight with Ares when Gabe's voice interrupted from the living room. ""Hey, Sally! That meat loaf done yet or what?""  She closed her eyes. ""He isn't going to be happy to see you, Percy. The store got half a million phone calls today from Los Angeles ... something about free appliances.""  ""Oh, yeah. About that...""  She managed a weak smile. ""Just don't make him angrier, all right? Come on.""  In the month I'd been gone, the apartment had turned into Gabeland. Garbage was ankle deep on the carpet. The sofa had been reupholstered in beer cans. Dirty socks and underwear hung off the lampshades.  Gabe and three of his big goony friends were playing poker at the table.  When Gabe saw me, his cigar dropped out of his mouth. His face got redder than lava. ""You got nerve coming here, you little punk. I thought the police—""  ""He's not a fugitive after all,"" my mom interjected. ""Isn't that wonderful, Gabe?""  Gabe looked back and forth between us. He didn't seem to think my homecoming was so wonderful.  ""Bad enough I had to give back your life insurance money, Sally,"" he growled. ""Get me the phone. I'll call the cops.""  ""Gabe, no!""  He raised his eyebrows. ""Did you just say 'no'? You think I'm gonna put up with this punk again? I can still press charges against him for ruining my Camaro.""  ""But—""  He raised his hand, and my mother flinched.  For the first time, I realized something. Gabe had hit my mother. I didn't know when, or how much. But I was sure he'd done it. Maybe it had been going on for years, when I wasn't around.  A balloon of anger started expanding in my chest. I came toward Gabe, instinctively taking my pen out of my pocket.  He just laughed. ""What, punk? You gonna write on me? You touch me, and you are going to jail forever, you understand?""  ""Hey, Gabe,"" his friend Eddie interrupted. ""He's just a kid.""  Gabe looked at him resentfully and mimicked in a falsetto voice: ""Just a kid.""  His other friends laughed like idiots.  ""I'll be nice to you, punk."" Gabe showed me his tobacco-stained teeth. ""I'll give you five minutes to get your stuff and clear out. After that, I call the police.""  ""Gabe!"" my mother pleaded.  ""He ran away,"" Gabe told her. ""Let him stay gone.""  I was itching to uncap Riptide, but even if I did, the blade wouldn't hurt humans. And Gabe, by the loosest definition, was human.  My mother took my arm. ""Please, Percy. Come on. We'll go to your room.""  I let her pull me away, my hands still trembling with rage.  My room had been completely filled with Gabe's junk. I here were stacks of used car batteries, a rotting bouquet of sympathy flowers with a card from somebody who'd seen his Barbara Walters interview.  ""Gabe is just upset, honey,"" my mother told me. ""I'll talk to him later. I'm sure it will work out.""  ""Mom, it'll never work out. Not as long as Gabe's here.""  She wrung her hands nervously. ""I can ... I'll take you to work with me for the rest of the summer. In the fall, maybe there's another boarding school—"" ""Mom.""  She lowered her eyes. ""I'm trying, Percy. I just... I need some time.""  A package appeared on my bed. At least, I could've sworn it hadn't been there a moment before.  It was a battered cardboard box about the right size to fit a basketball. The address on the mailing slip was in my own handwriting:  The Gods  Mount Olympus  600th Floor,  Empire StateBuilding  New York, NY  With best wishes,  PERCY JACKSON  Over the top in black marker, in a man's clear, bold print, was the address of our apartment, and the words: RETURN TO SENDER.  Suddenly I understood what Poseidon had told me on Olympus.  A package. A decision.  Whatever else you do, know that you are mine. You are a true son of the Sea God.  I looked at my mother. ""Mom, do you want Gabe gone?  ""Percy, it isn't that simple. I—""  ""Mom, just tell me. That jerk has been hitting you. Do you want him gone or not?""  She hesitated, then nodded almost imperceptibly. ""Yes, Percy. I do. And I'm trying to get up my courage to tell him. But you can't do this for me. You can't solve my problems.""  I looked at the box.  I could solve her problem. I wanted to slice that package open, plop it on the poker table, and take out what was inside. I could start my very own statue garden, right there in the living room.  That's what a Greek hero would do in the stories, I thought. That's what Gabe deserves.  But a hero's story always ended in tragedy. Poseidon had told me that.  I remembered the Underworld. I thought about Gabe's spirit drifting forever in the Fields of Asphodel, or condemned to some hideous torture behind the barbed wire of the Fields of Punishment—an eternal poker game, sitting up to his waist in boiling oil listening to opera music. Did I have the right to send someone there? Even Gabe?  A month ago, I wouldn't have hesitated. Now ...  ""I can do it,"" I told my mom. ""One look inside this box, and he'll never bother you again.""  She glanced at the package, and seemed to understand immediately. ""No, Percy,"" she said, stepping away. ""You can't.""  ""Poseidon called you a queen,"" I told her. ""He said he hadn't met a woman like you in a thousand years.""  Her cheeks flushed. ""Percy—""  ""You deserve better than this, Mom. You should go to college, get your degree. You can write your novel, meet a nice guy maybe, live in a nice house. You don't need to protect me anymore by staying with Gabe. Let me get rid of him.""  She wiped a tear off her cheek. ""You sound so much like your father,"" she said. ""He offered to stop the tide for me once. He offered to build me a palace at the bottom of the sea. He thought he could solve all my problems with a wave of his hand.""  ""What's wrong with that?""  Her multicolored eyes seemed to search inside me. ""I think you know, Percy. I think you're enough like me to understand. If my life is going to mean anything, I have to live it myself. I can't let a god take care of me ... or my son. I have to ... find the courage on my own. Your quest has reminded me of that.""  We listened to the sound of poker chips and swearing, ESPN from the living room television.  ""I'll leave the box,"" I said. ""If he threatens you ...""  She looked pale, but she nodded. ""Where will you go, Percy?""  ""Half-Blood Hill.""  ""For the summer ... or forever?""  ""I guess that depends.""  We locked eyes, and I sensed that we had an agreement. We would see how things stood at the end of the summer.  She kissed my forehead. ""You'll be a hero, Percy. You'll be the greatest of all.""  I took one last look around my bedroom. I had a feeling I'd never see it again. Then I walked with my mother to the front door.  ""Leaving so soon, punk?"" Gabe called after me. ""Good riddance.""  I had one last twinge of doubt. How could I turn down the perfect chance to take revenge on him? I was leaving here without saving my mother.  ""Hey, Sally,"" he yelled. ""What about that meat loaf, huh?""  A steely look of anger flared in my mother's eyes, and I thought, just maybe, I was leaving her in good hands after all. Her own.  ""The meat loaf is coming right up, dear,"" she told Gabe. ""Meat loaf surprise.""  She looked at me, and winked.  The last thing I saw as the door swung closed was my mother staring at Gabe, as if she were contemplating how he would look as a garden statue."
Percy Jackson 1 Chapter 22,"We were the first heroes to return alive to Half-Blood Hill since Luke, so of course everybody treated us as if we'd won some reality-TV contest. According to camp tradition, we wore laurel wreaths to a big feast prepared in our honor, then led a procession down to the bonfire, where we got to burn the burial shrouds our cabins had made for us in our absence.  Annabeth's shroud was so beautiful—gray silk with embroidered owls—I told her it seemed a shame not to bury her in it. She punched me and told me to shut up.  Being the son of Poseidon, I didn't have any cabin mates, so the Ares cabin had volunteered to make my shroud. They'd taken an old bedsheet and painted smiley faces with X'ed-out eyes around the border, and the word LOSER painted really big in the middle.  It was fun to burn.  As Apollo's cabin led the sing-along and passed out s'mores, I was surrounded by my old Hermes cabinmates, Annabeth's friends from Athena, and Grover's satyr buddies, who were admiring the brand-new searcher's license he'd received from the Council of Cloven Elders. The council had called Grover's performance on the quest ""Brave to the point of indigestion. Horns-and-whiskers above anything we have seen in the past.""  The only ones not in a party mood were Clarisse and her cabinmates, whose poisonous looks told me they'd never forgive me for disgracing their dad.  That was okay with me.  Even Dionysus's welcome-home speech wasn't enough to dampen my spirits. ""Yes, yes, so the little brat didn't get himself killed and now he'll have an even bigger head. Well, huzzah for that. In other announcements, there will be no canoe races this Saturday....""  I moved back into cabin three, but it didn't feel so lonely anymore. I had my friends to train with during the day. At night, I lay awake and listened to the sea, knowing my father was out there. Maybe he wasn't quite sure about me yet, maybe he hadn't even wanted me born, but he was watching. And so far, he was proud of what I'd done.  As for my mother, she had a chance at a new life. Her letter arrived a week after I got back to camp. She told me Gabe had left mysteriously—disappeared off the face of the planet, in fact. She'd reported him missing to the police, but she had a funny feeling they would never find him.  On a completely unrelated subject, she'd sold her first life-size concrete sculpture, entitled The Poker Player, to a collector, through an art gallery in Soho. She'd gotten so much money for it, she'd put a deposit down on a new apartment and made a payment on her first semester's tuition at NYU. The Soho gallery was clamoring for more of her work, which they called ""a huge step forward in super-ugly neorealism.""  But don't worry, my mom wrote. I'm done with sculpture. I've disposed of that box of tools you left me. It's time for me to turn to writing.  At the bottom, she wrote a P.S.: Percy, I've found a good private school here in the city. I've put a deposit down to hold you a spot, in case you want to enroll for seventh grade. You could live at home. But if you want to go year-round at Half-Blood Hill, I'll understand.  I folded the note carefully and set it on my bedside table. Every night before I went to sleep, I read it again, and I tried to decide how to answer her.  On the Fourth of July, the whole camp gathered at the beach for a fireworks display by cabin nine. Being Hephaestus's kids, they weren't going to settle for a few lame red-white-and-blue explosions. They'd anchored a barge offshore and loaded it with rockets the size of Patriot missiles. According to Annabeth, who'd seen the show before, the blasts would be sequenced so tightly they'd look like frames of animation across the sky. The finale was supposed to be a couple of hundred-foot-tall Spartan warriors who would crackle to life above the ocean, fight a battle, then explode into a million colors.  As Annabeth and I were spreading a picnic blanket, Grover showed up to tell us good-bye. He was dressed in his usual jeans and T-shirt and sneakers, but in the last few weeks he'd started to look older, almost high-school age. His goatee had gotten thicker. He'd put on weight. His horns had grown at least an inch, so he now had to wear his rasta cap all the time to pass as human.  ""I'm off,"" he said. ""I just came to say ... well, you know.""  I tried to feel happy for him. After all, it wasn't every day a satyr got permission to go look for the great god Pan. But it was hard saying good-bye. I'd only known Grover a year, yet he was my oldest friend.  Annabeth gave him a hug. She told him to keep his fake feet on.  I asked him where he was going to search first.  ""Kind of a secret,"" he said, looking embarrassed. ""I wish you could come with me, guys, but humans and Pan ...""  ""We understand,"" Annabeth said. ""You got enough tin cans for the trip?""  ""Yeah.""  ""And you remembered your reed pipes?""  ""Jeez, Annabeth,"" he grumbled. ""You're like an old mama goat.""  But he didn't really sound annoyed.  He gripped his walking stick and slung a backpack over his shoulder. He looked like any hitchhiker you might see on an American highway—nothing like the little runty boy I used to defend from bullies at YancyAcademy.  ""Well,"" he said, ""wish me luck.""  He gave Annabeth another hug. He clapped me on the shoulder, then headed back through the dunes.  Fireworks exploded to life overhead: Hercules killing the Nemean lion, Artemis chasing the boar, George Washington (who, by the way, was a son of Athena) crossing the Delaware.  ""Hey, Grover,"" I called.  He turned at the edge of the woods.  ""Wherever you're going—I hope they make good enchiladas.""  Grover grinned, and then he was gone, the trees closing around him.  ""We'll see him again,"" Annabeth said.  I tried to believe it. The fact that no searcher had ever come back in two thousand years ... well, I decided not to think about that. Grover would be the first. He had to be.  July passed.  I spent my days devising new strategies for capture-the-flag and making alliances with the other cabins to keep the banner out of Ares's hands. I got to the top of the climbing wall for the first time without getting scorched by lava.  From time to time, I'd walk past the Big House, glance up at the attic windows, and think about the Oracle. I tried to convince myself that its prophecy had come to completion.  You shall go west, and face the god who has turned.  Been there, done that—even though the traitor god had turned out to be Ares rather than Hades.  You shall find what was stolen, and see it safe returned.  Check. One master bolt delivered. One helm of darkness back on Hades's oily head.  You shall be betrayed by one who calls you a friend.  This line still bothered me. Ares had pretended to be my friend, then betrayed me. That must be what the Oracle meant.... And you shall fail to save what matters most, in the end.  I had failed to save my mom, but only because I'd let her save herself, and I knew that was the right thing.  So why was I still uneasy?  The last night of the summer session came all too quickly.  The campers had one last meal together. We burned part of our dinner for the gods. At the bonfire, the senior counselors awarded the end-of-summer beads.  I got my own leather necklace, and when I saw the bead for my first summer, I was glad the firelight covered my blushing. The design was pitch black, with a sea-green trident shimmering in the center.  ""The choice was unanimous,"" Luke announced. ""This bead commemorates the first Son of the Sea God at this camp, and the quest he undertook into the darkest part of the Underworld to stop a war!""  The entire camp got to their feet and cheered. Even Ares's cabin felt obliged to stand. Athena's cabin steered Annabeth to the front so she could share in the applause.  I'm not sure I'd ever felt as happy or sad as I did at that moment. I'd finally found a family, people who cared about me and thought I'd done something right. And in the morning, most of them would be leaving for the year.  * * *  The next morning, I found a form letter on my bedside table.  I knew Dionysus must've filled it out, because he stubbornly insisted on getting my name wrong:  Dear______ Peter Johnson_______ ,  If you intend to stay at CampHalf-Blood year-round, you must inform the Big House by noon today. If you do not announce your intentions, we will assume you have vacated your cabin or died a horrible death. Cleaning harpies will begin work at sundown. They will be authorized to eat any unregistered campers. All personal articles left behind will be incinerated in the lava pit.  Have a nice day!  Mr. D (Dionysus)  Camp Director, Olympian Council #12  That's another thing about ADHD. Deadlines just aren't real to me until I'm staring one in the face. Summer was over, and I still hadn't answered my mother, or the camp, about whether I'd be staying. Now I had only a few hours to decide.  The decision should have been easy. I mean, nine months of hero training or nine months of sitting in a classroom—duh.  But there was my mom to consider. For the first time, I had the chance to live with her for a whole year, without Gabe. I had a chance be at home and knock around the city in my free time. I remembered what Annabeth had said so long ago on our quest: The real world is where the monsters are. That's where you learn whether you're any good or not.  I thought about the fate of Thalia, daughter of Zeus. I wondered how many monsters would attack me if I left Half-Blood Hill. If I stayed in one place for a whole school year, without Chiron or my friends around to help me, would my mother and I even survive until the next summer? That was assuming the spelling tests and five-paragraph essays didn't kill me. I decided I'd go down to the arena and do some sword practice. Maybe that would clear my head.  The campgrounds were mostly deserted, shimmering in the August heat. All the campers were in their cabins packing up, or running around with brooms and mops, getting ready for final inspection. Argus was helping some of the Aphrodite kids haul their Gucci suitcases and makeup kits over the hill, where the camp's shuttle bus would be waiting to take them to the airport.  Don't think about leaving yet, I told myself. Just train.  I got to the sword-fighters arena and found that Luke had had the same idea. His gym bag was plopped at the edge of the stage. He was working solo, whaling on battle dummies with a sword I'd never seen before. It must've been a regular steel blade, because he was slashing the dummies' heads right off, stabbing through their straw-stuffed guts. His orange counselor's shirt was dripping with sweat. His expression was so intense, his life might've really been in danger. I watched, fascinated, as he disemboweled the whole row of dummies, hacking off limbs and basically reducing them to a pile of straw and armor.  They were only dummies, but I still couldn't help being awed by Luke's skill. The guy was an incredible fighter. It made me wonder, again, how he possibly could've failed at his quest.  Finally, he saw me, and stopped mid-swing. ""Percy.""  ""Um, sorry,"" I said, embarrassed. ""I just—""  ""It's okay,"" he said, lowering his sword. ""Just doing some last-minute practice.""  ""Those dummies won't be bothering anybody anymore.""  Luke shrugged. ""We build new ones every summer.""  Now that his sword wasn't swirling around, I could see something odd about it. The blade was two different types of metal—one edge bronze, the other steel.  Luke noticed me looking at it. ""Oh, this? New toy. This is Backbiter.""  ""Backbiter?""  Luke turned the blade in the light so it glinted wickedly. ""One side is celestial bronze. The other is tempered steel. Works on mortals and immortals both.""  I thought about what Chiron had told me when I started my quest—that a hero should never harm mortals unless absolutely necessary.  ""I didn't know they could make weapons like that.""  ""They probably can't,"" Luke agreed. ""It's one of a kind.""  He gave me a tiny smile, then slid the sword into its scabbard. ""Listen, I was going to come looking for you. What do you say we go down to the woods one last time, look for something to fight?""  I don't know why I hesitated. I should've felt relieved that Luke was being so friendly. Ever since I'd gotten back from the quest, he'd been acting a little distant. I was afraid he might resent me for all the attention I'd gotten.  ""You think it's a good idea?"" I asked. ""I mean—""  ""Aw, come on."" He rummaged in his gym bag and pulled out a six-pack of Cokes. ""Drinks are on me.""  I stared at the Cokes, wondering where the heck he'd gotten them. There were no regular mortal sodas at the camp store. No way to smuggle them in unless you talked to a satyr, maybe.  Of course, the magic dinner goblets would fill with anything you want, but it just didn't taste the same as a real Coke, straight out of the can.  Sugar and caffeine. My willpower crumbled.  ""Sure,"" I decided. ""Why not?""  We walked down to the woods and kicked around for some kind of monster to fight, but it was too hot. All the monsters with any sense must've been taking siestas in their nice cool caves.  We found a shady spot by the creek where I'd broken Clarisse's spear during my first capture the flag game. We sat on a big rock, drank our Cokes, and watched the sunlight in the woods.  After a while Luke said, ""You miss being on a quest?""  ""With monsters attacking me every three feet? Are you kidding?""  Luke raised an eyebrow.  ""Yeah, I miss it,"" I admitted. ""You?""  A shadow passed over his face.  I was used to hearing from the girls how good-looking Luke was, but at the moment, he looked weary, and angry, and not at all handsome. His blond hair was gray in the sunlight. The scar on his face looked deeper than usual. I could imagine him as an old man.  ""I've lived at Half-Blood Hill year-round since I was fourteen,"" he told me. ""Ever since Thalia ... well, you know. I trained, and trained, and trained. I never got to be a normal teenager, out there in the real world. Then they threw me one quest, and when I came back, it was like, 'Okay, ride's over. Have a nice life.'""  He crumpled his Coke can and threw into the creek, which really shocked me. One of the first things you learn at CampHalf-Blood is: Don't litter. You'll hear from the nymphs and the naiads. They'll get even. You'll crawl into bed one night and find your sheets filled with centipedes and mud.  ""The heck with laurel wreaths,"" Luke said. ""I'm not going to end up like those dusty trophies in the Big House attic.""  ""You make it sound like you're leaving.""  Luke gave me a twisted smile. ""Oh, I'm leaving, all right, Percy. I brought you down here to say good-bye.""  He snapped his fingers. A small fire burned a hole in the ground at my feet. Out crawled something glistening black, about the size of my hand. A scorpion.  I started to go for my pen.  ""I wouldn't,"" Luke cautioned. ""Pit scorpions can jump up to fifteen feet. Its stinger can pierce right through your clothes. You'll be dead in sixty seconds.""  ""Luke, what—""  Then it hit me.  You will be betrayed by one who calls you a friend.  ""You,"" I said.  He stood calmly and brushed off his jeans.  The scorpion paid him no attention. It kept its beady black eyes on me, clamping its pincers as it crawled onto my shoe.  ""I saw a lot out there in the world, Percy,"" Luke said. ""Didn't you feel it—the darkness gathering, the monsters growing stronger? Didn't you realize how useless it all is? All the heroics—being pawns of the gods. They should've been overthrown thousands of years ago, but they've hung on, thanks to us half-bloods.""  I couldn't believe this was happening.  ""Luke ... you're talking about our parents,"" I said.  He laughed. ""That's supposed to make me love them? Their precious 'Western civilization is a disease, Percy. It's killing the world. The only way to stop it is to burn it to the ground, start over with something more honest.""  ""You're as crazy as Ares.""  His eyes flared. ""Ares is a fool. He never realized the true master he was serving. If I had time, Percy, I could explain. But I'm afraid you won't live that long.""  The scorpion crawled onto my pants leg.  There had to be a way out of this. I needed time to think.  ""Kronos,"" I said. ""That's who you serve.""  The air got colder.  ""You should be careful with names,"" Luke warned.  ""Kronos got you to steal the master bolt and the helm. He spoke to you in your dreams.""  Luke's eye twitched. ""He spoke to you, too, Percy. You should've listened.""  ""He's brainwashing you, Luke.""  ""You're wrong. He showed me that my talents are being wasted. You know what my quest was two years ago, Percy? My father, Hermes, wanted me to steal a golden apple from the Garden of the Hesperides and return it to Olympus. After all the training I'd done, that was the best he could think up.""  ""That's not an easy quest,"" I said. ""Hercules did it.""  ""Exactly,"" Luke said. ""Where's the glory in repeating what others have done? All the gods know how to do is replay their past. My heart wasn't in it. The dragon in the garden gave me this""—he pointed angrily at his scar—""and when I came back, all I got was pity. I wanted to pull Olympus down stone by stone right then, but I bided my time. I began to dream of Kronos. He convinced me to steal something worthwhile, something no hero had ever had the courage to take. When we went on that winter-solstice field trip, while the other campers were asleep, I snuck into the throne room and took Zeus's master bolt right from his chair. Hades's helm of darkness, too. You wouldn't believe how easy it was. The Olympians are so arrogant; they never dreamed someone would dare steal from them. Their security is horrible. I was halfway across New Jersey before I heard the storms rumbling, and I knew they'd discovered my theft.""  The scorpion was sitting on my knee now, staring at me with its glittering eyes. I tried to keep my voice level. ""So why didn't you bring the items to Kronos?"" Luke's smile wavered. ""I ... I got overconfident. Zeus sent out his sons and daughters to find the stolen bolt— Artemis, Apollo, my father, Hermes. But it was Ares who caught me. I could have beaten him, but I wasn't careful enough. He disarmed me, took the items of power, threatened to return them to Olympus and burn me alive. Then Kronos's voice came to me and told me what to say. I put the idea in Ares's head about a great war between the gods. I said all he had to do was hide the items away for a while and watch the others fight. Ares got a wicked gleam in his eyes. I knew he was hooked. He let me go, and I returned to Olympus before anyone noticed my absence."" Luke drew his new sword. He ran his thumb down the flat of the blade, as if he were hypnotized by its beauty. ""Afterward, the Lord of the Titans ... h-he punished me with nightmares. I swore not to fail again. Back at Camp Half-Blood, in my dreams, I was told that a second hero would arrive, one who could be tricked into taking the bolt and the helm the rest of the way—from Ares down to Tartarus.""  ""You summoned the hellhound, that night in the forest.""  ""We had to make Chiron think the camp wasn't safe for you, so he would start you on your quest. We had to confirm his fears that Hades was after you. And it worked.""  ""The flying shoes were cursed,"" I said. ""They were supposed to drag me and the backpack into Tartarus.""  ""And they would have, if you'd been wearing them. But you gave them to the satyr, which wasn't part of the plan. Grover messes up everything he touches. He even confused the curse.""  Luke looked down at the scorpion, which was now sitting on my thigh. ""You should have died in Tartarus, Percy. But don't worry, I'll leave you with my little friend to set things right.""  ""Thalia gave her life to save you,"" I said, gritting my teeth. ""And this is how you repay her?""  ""Don't speak of Thalia!"" he shouted. ""The gods let her die! That's one of the many things they will pay for.""  ""You're being used, Luke. You and Ares both. Don't listen to Kronos.""  ""I've been used?"" Luke's voice turned shrill. ""Look at yourself. What has your dad ever done for you? Kronos will rise. You've only delayed his plans. He will cast the Olympians into Tartarus and drive humanity back to their caves. All except the strongest—the ones who serve him.""  ""Call off the bug,"" I said. ""If you're so strong, fight me yourself""  Luke smiled. ""Nice try, Percy. But I'm not Ares. You can't bait me. My lord is waiting, and he's got plenty of quests for me to undertake.""  ""Luke—""  ""Good-bye, Percy. There is a new Golden Age coming. You won't be part of it.""  He slashed his sword in an arc and disappeared in a ripple of darkness.  The scorpion lunged.  I swatted it away with my hand and uncapped my sword. The thing jumped at me and I cut it in half in midair.  I was about to congratulate myself until I looked down at my hand. My palm had a huge red welt, oozing and smoking with yellow guck. The thing had gotten me after all.  My ears pounded. My vision went foggy. The water, I thought. It healed me before.  I stumbled to the creek and submerged my hand, but nothing seemed to happen. The poison was too strong. My vision was getting dark. I could barely stand up.  Sixty seconds, Luke had told me.  I had to get back to camp. If I collapsed out here, my body would be dinner for a monster. Nobody would ever know what had happened.  My legs felt like lead. My forehead was burning. I stumbled toward the camp, and the nymphs stirred from their trees.  ""Help,"" I croaked. ""Please ...""  Two of them took my arms, pulling me along. I remember making it to the clearing, a counselor shouting for help, a centaur blowing a conch horn.  Then everything went black.  * * *  I woke with a drinking straw in my mouth. I was sipping something that tasted like liquid chocolate-chip cookies. Nectar.  I opened my eyes.  I was propped up in bed in the sickroom of the Big House, my right hand bandaged like a club. Argus stood guard in the corner. Annabeth sat next to me, holding my nectar glass and dabbing a washcloth on my forehead.  ""Here we are again,"" I said.  ""You idiot,"" Annabeth said, which is how I knew she was overjoyed to see me conscious. ""You were green and turning gray when we found you. If it weren't for Chiron's healing ...""  ""Now, now,"" Chiron's voice said. ""Percy's constitution deserves some of the credit.""  He was sitting near the foot of my bed in human form, which was why I hadn't noticed him yet. His lower half was magically compacted into the wheelchair, his upper half dressed in a coat and tie. He smiled, but his face looked weary and pale, the way it did when he'd been up all night grading Latin papers.  ""How are you feeling?"" he asked.  ""Like my insides have been frozen, then microwaved.""  ""Apt, considering that was pit scorpion venom. Now you must tell me, if you can, exactly what happened.""  Between sips of nectar, I told them the story.  The room was quiet for a long time.  ""I can't believe that Luke ..."" Annabeth's voice faltered. Her expression turned angry and sad. ""Yes. Yes, I can believe it. May the gods curse him.... He was never the same after his quest.""  ""This must be reported to Olympus,"" Chiron murmured. ""I will go at once.""  ""Luke is out there right now,"" I said. ""I have to go after him.""  Chiron shook his head. ""No, Percy. The gods—""  ""Won't even talk about Kronos,"" I snapped. ""Zeus declared the matter closed!""  ""Percy, I know this is hard. But you must not rush out for vengeance. You aren't ready.""  I didn't like it, but part of me suspected Chiron was right. One look at my hand, and I knew I wasn't going to be sword fighting any time soon. ""Chiron ... your prophecy from the Oracle ... it was about Kronos, wasn't it? Was I in it? And Annabeth?""  Chiron glanced nervously at the ceiling. ""Percy, it isn't my place—""  ""You've been ordered not to talk to me about it, haven't you?"" His eyes were sympathetic, but sad. ""You will be a great hero, child. I will do my best to prepare you. But if I'm right about the path ahead of you ...""  Thunder boomed overhead, rattling the windows.  ""All right!"" Chiron shouted. ""Fine!""  He sighed in frustration. ""The gods have their reasons, Percy. Knowing too much of your future is never a good thing.""  ""We can't just sit back and do nothing,"" I said.  ""We will not sit back,"" Chiron promised. ""But you must be careful. Kronos wants you to come unraveled. He wants your life disrupted, your thoughts clouded with fear and anger. Do not give him what he wants. Train patiently. Your time will come.""  ""Assuming I live that long.""  Chiron put his hand on my ankle. ""You'll have to trust me, Percy. You will live. But first you must decide your path for the coming year. I cannot tell you the right choice...."" I got the feeling that he had a very definite opinion, and it was taking all his willpower not to advise me. ""But you must decide whether to stay at CampHalf-Blood year-round, or return to the mortal world for seventh grade and be a summer camper. Think on that. When I get back from Olympus, you must tell me your decision.""  I wanted to protest. I wanted to ask him more questions. But his expression told me there could be no more discussion; he had said as much as he could.  ""I'll be back as soon as I can,"" Chiron promised. ""Argus will watch over you.""  He glanced at Annabeth. ""Oh, and, my dear ... whenever you're ready, they're here.""  ""Who's here?"" I asked.  Nobody answered.  Chiron rolled himself out of the room. I heard the wheels of his chair clunk carefully down the front steps, two at a time.  Annabeth studied the ice in my drink.  ""What's wrong?"" I asked her.  ""Nothing.""  She set the glass on the table. ""I … just took your advice about something. You … um … need anything?""  ""Yeah. Help me up. I want to go outside.""  ""Percy, that isn't a good idea.""  I slid my legs out of bed. Annabeth caught me before I could crumple to the floor. A wave of nausea rolled over me.  Annabeth said, ""I told you …""  ""I'm fine,"" I insisted. I didn't want to lie in bed like an invalid while Luke was out there planning to destroy the Western world.  I managed a step forward. Then another, still leaning heavily on Annabeth. Argus followed us outside, but he kept his distance.  By the time we reached the porch, my face was beaded with sweat.  My stomach had twisted into knots. But I had managed to make it all the way to the railing.  It was dusk. The camp looked completely deserted. The cabins were dark and the volleyball pit silent. No canoes cut the surface of the lake. Beyond the woods and the strawberry fields, the Long Island Sound glittered in the last light of the sun.  ""What are you going to do?"" Annabeth asked me.  ""I don't know.""  I told her I got the feeling Chiron wanted me to stay year-round, to put in more individual training time, but I wasn't sure that's what I wanted. I admitted I'd feel bad about leaving her alone, though, with only Clarisse for company….  Annabeth pursed her lips, then said quietly, ""I'm going home for the year, Percy.""  I stared at her. ""You mean, to your dad's?""  She pointed toward the crest of Half-Blood Hill. Next to Thalia's pine tree, at the very edge of the camp's magical boundaries, a family stood silhouetted—two little children, a woman, and a tall man with blond hair. They seemed to be waiting. The man was holding a backpack that looked like the one Annabeth had gotten from Waterland in Denver.  ""I wrote him a letter when we got back,"" Annabeth said. ""Just like you suggested. I told him ... I was sorry. I'd come home for the school year if he still wanted me. He wrote back immediately. We decided ... we'd give it another try.""  ""That took guts.""  She pursed her lips. ""You won't try anything stupid during the school year, will you? At least … not without sending me an Iris-message?""  I managed a smile. ""I won't go looking for trouble. I usually don't have to.""  ""When I get back next summer,"" she said, ""we'll hunt down Luke. We'll ask for a quest, but if we don't get approval, we'll sneak off and do it anyway. Agreed?""  ""Sounds like a plan worthy of Athena.""  She held out her hand. I shook it.  ""Take care, Seaweed Brain,"" Annabeth told me. ""Keep your eyes open.""  ""You too, Wise Girl.""  I watched her walk up the hill and join her family. She gave her father an awkward hug and looked back at the valley one last time. She touched Thalia's pine tree, then allowed herself to be lead over the crest and into the mortal world.  For the first time at camp, I felt truly alone. I looked out at Long Island Sound and I remembered my father saying, The sea does not like to be restrained.  I made my decision.  I wondered, if Poseidon were watching, would he approve of my choice? ""I'll be back next summer,"" I promised him. ""I'll survive until then. After all, I am your son."" I asked Argus to take me down to cabin three, so I could pack my bags for home."
City of Ember Chapter 1,"In the city of Ember, the sky was always dark. The only light came from great flood lamps mounted on the buildings and at the tops of poles in the middle of the larger squares. When the lights were on, they cast a yellowish glow over the streets; people walking by threw long shadows that shortened and then stretched out again. When the lights were off, as they were between nine at night and six in the morning, the city was so dark that people might as well have been wearing blindfolds. Sometimes darkness fell in the middle of the day. The city of Ember was old, and everything in it, including the power lines, was in need of repair. So now and then the lights would flicker and go out. These were terrible moments for the people of Ember. As they came to a halt in the middle of the street or stood stock-still in their houses, afraid to move in the utter blackness, they were reminded of something they preferred not to think about: that someday the lights of the city might go out and never come back on. But most of the time life proceeded as it always had. Grown people did their work, and younger people, until they reached the age of twelve, went to school. On the last day of their final year, which was called Assignment Day, they were given jobs to do. The graduating students occupied Room 8 of the Ember School. On Assignment Day of the year 241, this classroom, usually noisy first thing in the morning, was completely silent. All twenty-four students sat upright and still at the desks they had grown too big for. They were waiting. The desks were arranged in four rows of six, one behind the other. In the last row sat a slender girl named Lina Mayfleet. She was winding a strand of her long, dark hair around her finger, winding and unwinding it again and again. Sometimes she plucked at a thread on her ragged cape or bent over to pull on her socks, which were loose and tended to slide down around her ankles. One of her feet tapped the floor softly. In the second row was a boy named Doon Harrow. He sat with his shoulders hunched, his eyes squeezed shut in concentration, and his hands clasped tightly together. His hair looked rumpled, as if he hadn’t combed it for a while. He had dark, thick eyebrows, which made him look serious at the best of times and, when he was anxious or angry, came together to form a straight line across his forehead. His brown corduroy jacket was so old that its ridges had flattened out. Both the girl and the boy were making urgent wishes. Doon’s wish was very specific. He repeated it over and over again, his lips moving slightly, as if he could make it come true by saying it a thousand times. Lina was making her wish in pictures rather than in words. In her mind’s eye, she saw herself running through the streets of the city in a red jacket. She made this picture as bright and real as she could. Lina looked up and gazed around the schoolroom. She said a silent goodbye to everything that had been familiar for so long. Goodbye to the map of the city of Ember in its scarred wooden frame and the cabinet whose shelves held The Book of Numbers, The Book of Letters, and The Book of the City of Ember. Goodbye to the cabinet drawers labeled “New Paper” and “Old Paper.” Goodbye to the three electric lights in the ceiling that seemed always, no matter where you sat, to cast the shadow of your head over the page you were writing on. And goodbye to their teacher, Miss Thorn, who had finished her Last Day of School speech, wishing them luck in the lives they were about to begin. Now, having run out of things to say, she was standing at her desk with her frayed shawl clasped around her shoulders. And still the mayor, the guest of honor, had not arrived. Someone’s foot scraped back and forth on the floor. Miss Thorn sighed. Then the door rattled open, and the mayor walked in. He looked annoyed, as though they were the ones who were late. “Welcome, Mayor Cole,” said Miss Thorn. She held out her hand to him. The mayor made his mouth into a smile. “Miss Thorn,” he said, enfolding her hand. “Greetings. Another year.” The mayor was a vast, heavy man, so big in the middle that his arms looked small and dangling. In one hand he held a little cloth bag. He lumbered to the front of the room and faced the students. His gray, drooping face appeared to be made of something stiffer than ordinary skin; it rarely moved except for making the smile that was on it now. “Young people of the Highest Class,” the mayor began. He stopped and scanned the room for several moments; his eyes seemed to look out from far back inside his head. He nodded slowly. “Assignment Day now, isn’t it? Yes. First we get our education. Then we serve our city.” Again his eyes moved back and forth along the rows of students, and again he nodded, as if someone had confirmed what he’d said. He put the little bag on Miss Thorn’s desk and rested his hand on it. “What will that service be, eh? Perhaps you’re wondering.” He did his smile again, and his heavy cheeks folded like drapes. Lina’s hands were cold. She wrapped her cape around her and pressed her hands between her knees. Please hurry, Mr. Mayor, she said silently. Please just let us choose and get it over with. Doon, in his mind, was saying the same thing, only he didn’t say please. “Something to remember,” the mayor said, holding up one finger. “Job you draw today is for three years. Then, Evaluation. Are you good at your job? Fine. You may keep it. Are you unsatisfactory? Is there a greater need elsewhere? You will be re-assigned. It is extremely important,” he said, jabbing his finger at the class, “for all…work…of Ember…to be done. To be properly done.” He picked up the bag and pulled open the drawstring. “So. Let us begin. Simple procedure. Come up one at a time. Reach into this bag. Take one slip of paper. Read it out loud.” He smiled and nodded. The flesh under his chin bulged in and out. “Who cares to be first?” No one moved. Lina stared down at the top of her desk. There was a long silence. Then Lizzie Bisco, one of Lina’s best friends, sprang to her feet. “I would like to be first,” she said in her breathless high voice. “Good. Walk forward.” Lizzie went to stand before the mayor. Because of her orange hair, she looked like a bright spark next to him. “Now choose.” The mayor held out the bag with one hand and put the other behind his back, as if to show he would not interfere. Lizzie reached into the bag and withdrew a tightly folded square of paper. She unfolded it carefully. Lina couldn’t see the look on Lizzie’s face, but she could hear the disappointment in her voice as she read out loud: “Supply Depot clerk.” “Very good,” said the mayor. “A vital job.” Lizzie trudged back to her desk. Lina smiled at her, but Lizzie made a sour face. Supply Depot clerk wasn’t a bad job, but it was a dull one. The Supply Depot clerks sat behind a long counter, took orders from the storekeepers of Ember, and sent the carriers down to bring up what was wanted from the vast network of storerooms beneath Ember’s streets. The storerooms held supplies of every kind—canned food, clothes, furniture, blankets, light bulbs, medicine, pots and pans, reams of paper, soap, more light bulbs—everything the people of Ember could possibly need. The clerks sat at their ledger books all day, recording the orders that came in and the goods that went out. Lizzie didn’t like to sit still; she would have been better suited to something else, Lina thought—messenger, maybe, the job Lina wanted for herself. Messengers ran through the city all day, going everywhere, seeing everything. “Next,” said the mayor. This time two people stood up at once, Orly Gordon and Chet Noam. Orly quickly sat down again, and Chet approached the mayor. “Choose, young man,” the mayor said. Chet chose. He unfolded his scrap of paper. “Electrician’s helper,” he read, and his wide face broke into a smile. Lina heard someone take a quick breath. She looked over to see Doon pressing a hand against his mouth. You never knew, each year, exactly which jobs would be offered. Some years there were several good jobs, like greenhouse helper, timekeeper’s assistant, or messenger, and no bad jobs at all. Other years, jobs like Pipeworks laborer, trash sifter, and mold scraper were mixed in. But there would always be at least one or two jobs for electrician’s helper. Fixing the electricity was the most important job in Ember, and more people worked at it than at anything else. Orly Gordon was next. She got the job of building repair assistant, which was a good job for Orly. She was a strong girl and liked hard work. Vindie Chance was made a greenhouse helper. She gave Lina a big grin as she went back to her seat. She’ll get to work with Clary, Lina thought. Lucky. So far no one had picked a really bad job. Perhaps this time there would be no bad jobs at all. The idea gave her courage. Besides, she had reached the point where the suspense was giving her a stomach ache. So as Vindie sat down—even before the mayor could say “Next”—she stood up and stepped forward. The little bag was made of faded green material, gathered at the top with a black string. Lina hesitated a moment, then put her hand inside and fingered the bits of paper. Feeling as if she were stepping off a high building, she picked one. She unfolded it. The words were written in black ink, in small careful printing. PIPEWORKS LABORER, they said. She stared at them. “Out loud, please,” the mayor said. “Pipeworks laborer,” Lina said in a choked whisper. “Louder,” said the mayor. “Pipeworks laborer,” Lina said again, her voice loud and cracked. There was a sigh of sympathy from the class. Keeping her eyes on the floor, Lina went back to her desk and sat down. Pipeworks laborers worked below the storerooms in the deep labyrinth of tunnels that contained Ember’s water and sewer pipes. They spent their days stopping up leaks and replacing pipe joints. It was wet, cold work; it could even be dangerous. A swift underground river ran through the Pipeworks, and every now and then someone fell into it and was lost. People were lost occasionally in the tunnels, too, if they strayed too far. Lina stared miserably down at a letter B someone had scratched into her desktop long ago. Almost anything would have been better than Pipeworks laborer. Greenhouse helper had been her second choice. She imagined with longing the warm air and earthy smell of the greenhouse, where she could have worked with Clary, the greenhouse manager, someone she’d known all her life. She would have been content as a doctor’s assistant, too, binding up cuts and bones. Even street-sweeper or cart-puller would have been better. At least then she could have stayed above ground, with space and people around her. She thought going down into the Pipeworks must be like being buried alive. One by one, the other students chose their jobs. None of them got such a wretched job as hers. Finally the last person rose from his chair and walked forward. It was Doon. His dark eyebrows were drawn together in a frown of concentration. His hands, Lina saw, were clenched into fists at his sides. Doon reached into the bag and took out the last scrap of paper. He paused a minute, pressing it tightly in his hand. “Go on,” said the mayor. “Read.” Unfolding the paper, Doon read: “Messenger.” He scowled, crumpled the paper, and dashed it to the floor. Lina gasped; the whole class rustled in surprise. Why would anyone be angry to get the job of messenger? “Bad behavior!” cried the mayor. His eyes bulged and his face darkened. “Go to your seat immediately.” Doon kicked the crumpled paper into a corner. Then he stalked back to his desk and flung himself down. The mayor took a short breath and blinked furiously. “Disgraceful,” he said, glaring at Doon. “A childish display of temper! Students should be glad to work for their city. Ember will prosper if all…citizens…do…their…best.” He held up a stern finger as he said this and moved his eyes slowly from one face to the next. Suddenly Doon spoke up. “But Ember is not prospering!” he cried. “Everything is getting worse and worse!” “Silence!” cried the mayor. “The blackouts!” cried Doon. He jumped from his seat. “The lights go out all the time now! And the shortages, there’s shortages of everything! If no one does anything about it, something terrible is going to happen!” Lina listened with a pounding heart. What was wrong with Doon? Why was he so upset? He was taking things too seriously, as he always did. Miss Thorn strode to Doon and put a hand on his shoulder. “Sit down now,” she said quietly. But Doon remained standing. The mayor glared. For a few moments he said nothing. Then he smiled, showing a neat row of gray teeth. “Miss Thorn,” he said. “Who might this young man be?” “I am Doon Harrow,” said Doon. “I will remember you,” said the mayor. He gave Doon a long look, then turned to the class and smiled his smile again. “Congratulations to all,” he said. “Welcome to Ember’s work force. Miss Thorn. Class. Thank you.” The mayor shook hands with Miss Thorn and departed. The students gathered their coats and caps and filed out of the classroom. Lina walked down the Wide Hallway with Lizzie, who said, “Poor you! I thought I picked a bad one, but you got the worst. I feel lucky compared to you.” Once they were out the door, Lizzie said goodbye and scurried away, as if Lina’s bad luck were a disease she might catch. Lina stood on the steps for a moment and gazed across Harken Square, where people walked briskly, bundled up cozily in their coats and scarves, or talked to one another in the pools of light beneath the great streetlamps. A boy in a red messenger’s jacket ran toward the Gathering Hall. On Otterwill Street, a man pulled a cart filled with sacks of potatoes. And in the buildings all around the square, rows of lighted windows shone bright yellow and deep gold. Lina sighed. This was where she wanted to be, up here where everything happened, not down underground. Someone tapped her on the shoulder. Startled, she turned and saw Doon behind her. His thin face looked pale. “Will you trade with me?” he asked. “Trade?” “Trade jobs. I don’t want to waste my time being a messenger. I want to help save the city, not run around carrying gossip.” Lina gaped at him. “You’d rather be in the Pipeworks?” “Electrician’s helper is what I wanted,” Doon said. “But Chet won’t trade, of course. Pipeworks is second best.” “But why?” “Because the generator is in the Pipeworks,” said Doon. Lina knew about the generator, of course. In some mysterious way, it turned the running of the river into power for the city. You could feel its deep rumble when you stood in Plummer Square. “I need to see the generator,” Doon said. “I have…I have ideas about it.” He thrust his hands into his pockets. “So,” he said, “will you trade?” “Yes!” cried Lina. “Messenger is the job I want most!” And not a useless job at all, in her opinion. People couldn’t be expected to trudge halfway across the city every time they wanted to communicate with someone. Messengers connected everyone to everyone else. Anyway, whether it was important or not, the job of messenger just happened to be perfect for Lina. She loved to run. She could run forever. And she loved exploring every nook and cranny of the city, which was what a messenger got to do. “All right then,” said Doon. He handed her his crumpled piece of paper, which he must have retrieved from the floor. Lina reached into her pocket, pulled out her slip of paper, and handed it to him. “Thank you,” he said. “You’re welcome,” said Lina. Happiness sprang up in her, and happiness always made her want to run. She took the steps three at a time and sped down Broad Street toward home."
City of Ember Chapter 2,"Lina often took different routes between school and home. Sometimes, just for variety, she’d go all the way around Sparkswallow Square, or way up by the shoe repair shops on Liverie Street. But today she took the shortest route because she was eager to get home and tell her news. She ran fast and easily through the streets of Ember. Every corner, every alley, every building was familiar to her. She always knew where she was, though most streets looked more or less the same. All of them were lined with old two-story stone buildings, the wood of their window frames and doors long unpainted. On the street level were shops; above the shops were the apartments where people lived. Every building, at the place where the wall met the roof, was equipped with a row of floodlights—big cone-shaped lamps that cast a strong yellow glare. Stone walls, lighted windows, lumpy, muffled shapes of people—Lina flew by them. Her slender legs felt immensely strong, like the wood of a bow that flexes and springs. She darted around obstacles—broken furniture left for the trash heaps or for scavengers, stoves and refrigerators that were past repair, peddlers sitting on the pavement with their wares spread out around them. She leapt over cracks and potholes. When she came to Hafter Street, she slowed a little. This street was deep in shadow. Four of its streetlamps were out and had not been fixed. For a second, Lina thought of the rumor she’d heard about light bulbs: that some kinds were completely gone. She was used to shortages of things—everyone was—but not of light bulbs! If the bulbs for the streetlamps ran out, the only lights would be inside the buildings. What would happen then? How could people find their way through the streets in the dark? Somewhere inside her, a black worm of dread stirred. She thought about Doon’s outburst in class. Could things really be as bad as he said? She didn’t want to believe it. She pushed the thought away. As she turned onto Budloe Street, she sped up again. She passed a line of customers waiting to get into the vegetable market, their shopping bags draped over their arms. At the corner of Oliver Street, she dodged a group of washers trudging along with bags of laundry, and some movers carrying away a broken table. She passed a street-sweeper shoving dust around with his broom. I am so lucky, she thought, to have the job I want. And because of Doon Harrow, of all people. When they were younger, Lina and Doon had been friends. Together they had explored the back alleys and dimly lit edges of the city. But in their fourth year of school, they had begun to grow apart. It started one day during the hour of free time, when the children in their class were playing on the front steps of the school. “I can go down three steps at a time,” someone would boast. “I can hop down on one foot!” someone else would say. The others would chime in. “I can do a handstand against the pillar!” “I can leapfrog over the trash can!” As soon as one child did something, all the rest would do it, too, to prove they could. Lina could do it all, even when the dares got wilder. She yelled out the wildest one of all: “I can climb the light pole!” For a second everyone just stared at her. But Lina dashed across the street, took off her shoes and socks, and wrapped herself around the cold metal of the pole. Pushing with her bare feet, she inched upward. She didn’t get very far before she lost her grip and fell back down. The children laughed, and so did she. “I didn’t say I’d climb to the top,” she explained. “I just said I’d climb it.” The others swarmed forward to try. Lizzie wouldn’t take off her socks—her feet were too cold,she said—so she kept sliding back. Fordy Penn wasn’t strong enough to get more than a foot off the ground. Next came Doon. He took his shoes and socks off and placed them neatly at the foot of the pole. Then he announced, in his serious way, “I’m going to the top.” He clasped the pole and started upward, pushing with his feet, his knees sticking out to the sides. He pulled himself upward, pushed again—he was higher now than Lina had been—but suddenly his hands slid and he came plummeting down. He landed on his bottom with his legs poking up in the air. Lina laughed. She shouldn’t have; he might have been hurt. But he looked so funny that she couldn’t help it. He wasn’t hurt. He could have jumped up, grinned, and walked away. But Doon didn’t take things lightly. When he heard Lina and the others laughing, his face darkened. His temper rose in him like hot water. “Don’t you dare laugh at me,” he said to Lina. “I did better than you did! That was a stupid idea anyway, a stupid, stupid idea to climb that pole.…” And as he was shouting, red in the face, their teacher, Mrs. Polster, came out onto the steps and saw him. She took him by the shirt collar to the school director’s office, where he got a scolding he didn’t think he deserved. After that day, Lina and Doon barely looked at each other when they passed in the hallway. At first it was because they were fuming about what had happened. Doon didn’t like being laughed at; Lina didn’t like being shouted at. After a while the memory of the light-pole incident faded, but by then they had got out of the habit of friendship. By the time they were twelve, they knew each other only as classmates. Lina was friends with Vindie Chance, Orly Gordon, and most of all, red-haired Lizzie Bisco, who could run almost as fast as Lina and could talk three times faster. — Now, as Lina sped toward home, she felt immensely grateful to Doon and hoped he’d come to no harm in the Pipeworks. Maybe they’d be friends again. She’d like to ask him about the Pipeworks. She was curious about it. When she got to Greystone Street, she passed Clary Laine, who was probably on her way to the greenhouses. Clary waved to her and called out, “What job?” and Lina called back, “Messenger!” and ran on. Lina lived in Quillium Square, over the yarn shop run by her grandmother. When she got to the shop, she burst in the door and cried, “Granny! I’m a messenger!” Granny’s shop had once been a tidy place, where each ball of yarn and spool of thread had its spot in the cubbyholes that lined the walls. All the yarn and thread came from old clothes that had gotten too shabby to be worn. Granny unraveled sweaters and picked apart dresses and jackets and pants; she wound the yarn into balls and the thread onto spools, and people bought them to use in making new clothes. These days, the shop was a mess. Long loops and strands of yarn dangled out of the cubbyholes, and the browns and grays and purples were mixed in with the ochres and olive greens and dark blues. Granny’s customers often had to spend half an hour unsnarling the rust-red yarn from the mud-brown, or trying to fish out the end of a thread from a tangled wad. Granny wasn’t much help. Most days she just dozed behind the counter in her rocking chair. That’s where she was when Lina burst in with her news. Lina saw that Granny had forgotten to knot up her hair that morning—it was standing out from her head in a wild white frizz. Granny stood up, looking puzzled. “You aren’t a messenger, dear, you’re a schoolgirl,” she said. “But Granny, today was Assignment Day. I got my job. And I’m a messenger!” Granny’s eyes lit up, and she slapped her hand down on the counter. “I remember!” she cried. “Messenger, that’s a grand job! You’ll be good at it.” Lina’s little sister toddled out from behind the counter on unsteady legs. She had a round face and round brown eyes. At the top of her head was a sprig of brown hair tied up with a scrap of red yarn. She grabbed on to Lina’s knees. “Wy-na, Wy-na!” she said. Lina bent over and took the child’s hands. “Poppy! Your big sister got a good job! Are you happy, Poppy? Are you proud of me?” Poppy said something that sounded like, “Hoppyhoppyhoppy!” Lina laughed, hoisted her up, and danced with her around the shop. Lina loved her little sister so much that it was like an ache under her ribs. The baby and Granny were all the family she had now. Two years ago, when the coughing sickness was raging through the city again, her father had died. Some months later, her mother, giving birth to Poppy, had died, too. Lina missed her parents with an ache that was as strong as what she felt for Poppy, only it was a hollow feeling instead of a full one. “When do you start?” asked Granny. “Tomorrow,” said Lina. “I report to the messengers’ station at eight o’clock.” “You’ll be a famous messenger,” said Granny. “Fast and famous.” Taking Poppy with her, Lina went out of the shop and climbed the stairs to their apartment. It was a small apartment, only four rooms, but there was enough stuff in it to fill twenty. There were things that had belonged to Lina’s parents, her grandparents, and even their grandparents—old, broken, cracked, threadbare things that had been patched and repaired dozens or hundreds of times. People in Ember rarely threw anything away. They made the best possible use of what they had. In Lina’s apartment, layers of worn rugs and carpets covered the floor, making it soft but uneven underfoot. Against one wall squatted a sagging couch with round wooden balls for legs, and on the couch were blankets and pillows, so many that you had to toss some on the floor before you could sit down. Against the opposite wall stood two wobbly tables that held a clutter of plates and bottles, cups and bowls, unmatching forks and spoons, little piles of scrap paper, bits of string wound up in untidy wads, and a few stubby pencils. There were four lamps, two tall ones that stood on the floor and two short ones that stood on tables. And in uneven lines up near the ceiling were hooks that held coats and shawls and nightgowns and sweaters, shelves that held pots and pans, jars with unreadable labels, and boxes of buttons and pins and tacks. Where there were no shelves, the walls had been decorated with things of beauty—a label from a can of peaches, a few dried yellow squash flowers, a strip of faded but still pretty purple cloth. There were drawings, too. Lina had done the drawings out of her imagination. They showed a city that looked somewhat like Ember, except that its buildings were lighter and taller and had more windows. One of the drawings had fallen to the floor. Lina retrieved it and pinned it back up. She stood for a minute and looked at the pictures. Over and over, she’d drawn the same city. Sometimes she drew it as seen from afar, sometimes she chose one of its buildings and drew it in detail. She put in stairways and streetlamps and carts. Sometimes she tried to draw the people who lived in the city, though she wasn’t good at drawing people—their heads always came out too small, and their hands looked like spiders. One picture showed a scene in which the people of the city greeted her when she arrived—the first person they had ever seen to come from elsewhere. They argued with each other about who should be the first to invite her home. Lina could see this city so clearly in her mind she almost believed it was real. She knew it couldn’t be, though. The Book of the City of Ember, which all children studied in school, taught otherwise. “The city of Ember was made for us long ago by the Builders,” the book said. “It is the only light in the dark world. Beyond Ember, the darkness goes on forever in all directions.” Lina had been to the outer border of Ember. She had stood at the edge of the trash heaps and gazed into the darkness beyond the city—the Unknown Regions. No one had ever gone far into the Unknown Regions—or at least no one had gone far and returned. And no one had ever arrived in Ember from the Unknown Regions, either. As far as anyone knew, the darkness did go on forever. Still, Lina wanted the other city to exist. In her imagination, it was so beautiful, and it seemed so real. Sometimes she longed to go there and take everyone in Ember with her. But she wasn’t thinking about the other city now. Today she was happy to be right where she was. She set Poppy on the couch. “Wait there,” she said. She went into the kitchen, where there was an electric stove and a refrigerator that no longer worked and was used to store glasses and dishes so Poppy couldn’t get at them. Above the refrigerator were shelves holding more pots and jars, more spoons and knives, a wind-up clock that Granny always forgot to wind, and a long row of cans. Lina tried to keep the cans in alphabetical order so she could find what she wanted quickly, but Granny always messed them up. Now, she saw, there were beans at the end of the row and tomatoes at the beginning. She picked out a can labeled Baby Drink and a jar of boiled carrots, opened them, poured the liquid into a cup and the carrots into a little dish, and took these back to the baby on the couch. Poppy dribbled Baby Drink down her chin. She ate some of her carrots and poked others between the couch cushions. For the moment, Lina felt almost perfectly happy. There was no need to think about the fate of the city right now. Tomorrow, she’d be a messenger! She wiped the orange goop off Poppy’s chin. “Don’t worry,” she said. “Everything will be all right.” — The messengers’ headquarters was on Cloving Street, not far from the back of the Gathering Hall. When Lina arrived the next morning, she was greeted by Messenger Captain Allis Fleery, a bony woman with pale eyes and hair the color of dust. “Our new girl,” said Captain Fleery to the other messengers, a cluster of nine people who smiled and nodded at Lina. “I have your jacket right here,” said the captain. She handed Lina a red jacket like the one all messengers wore. It was only a little too large. From the clock tower of the Gathering Hall came a deep reverberating bong. “Eight o’clock!” cried Captain Fleery. She waved a long arm. “Take your stations!” As the clock sounded seven more times, the messengers scattered in all directions. The captain turned to Lina. “Your station,” she said, “is Garn Square.” Lina nodded and started off, but the captain caught her by the collar. “I haven’t told you the rules,” she said. She held up a knobby finger. “One: When a customer gives you a message, repeat it back to make sure you have it right. Two: Always wear your red jacket so people can identify you. Three: Go as fast as possible. Your customers pay twenty cents for every message, no matter how far you have to take it.” Lina nodded. “I always go fast,” she said. “Four,” the captain went on. “Deliver a message only to the person it’s meant for, no one else.” Lina nodded again. She bounced a little on her toes, eager to get going. Captain Fleery smiled. “Go,” she said, and Lina was off. She felt strong and speedy and surefooted. She glanced at her reflection as she ran past the window of a furniture repair shop. She liked the look of her long dark hair flying out behind her, her long legs in their black socks, and her flapping red jacket. Her face, which had never seemed especially remarkable, looked almost beautiful, because she looked so happy. As soon as she came into Garn Square, a voice cried, “Messenger!” Her first customer! It was old Natty Prine, calling to her from the bench where he always sat. “This goes to Ravenet Parsons, 18 Selverton Square,” he said. “Bend down.” She bent down so that her ear was close to his whiskery mouth. The old man said in a slow, hoarse voice, “My stove is broke, don’t come for dinner. Repeat.” Lina repeated the message. “Good,” said Natty Prine. He gave Lina twenty cents, and she ran across the city to Selverton Square. There she found Ravenet Parsons also sitting on a bench. She recited the message to him. “Old turniphead,” he growled. “Lazy old fleaface. He just doesn’t feel like cooking. No reply.” Lina ran back to Garn Square, passing a group of Believers on the way. They were standing in a circle, holding hands, singing one of their cheerful songs. It seemed to Lina there were more Believers than ever these days. What they believed in she didn’t know, but it must make them happy—they were always smiling. Her next customer turned out to be Mrs. Polster, the teacher of the fourth-year class. In Mrs. Polster’s class, they memorized passages from The Book of the City of Ember every week. Mrs. Polster had charts on the walls for everything, with everyone’s name listed. If you did something right, she made a green dot by your name. If you did something wrong, she made a red dot. “What you need to learn, children,” she always said, in her resonant, precise voice, “is the difference between right and wrong in every area of life. And once you learn the difference—” Here she would stop and point to the class, and the class would finish the sentence: “You must always choose the right.” In every situation, Mrs. Polster knew what the right choice was. Now here was Mrs. Polster again, looming over Lina and pronouncing her message. “To Annisette Lafrond, 39 Humm Street, as follows,” she said. “My confidence in you has been seriously diminished since I heard about the disreputable activities in which you engaged on Thursday last. Please repeat.” It took Lina three tries to get this right. “Uh-oh, a red dot for me,” she said. Mrs. Polster did not seem to find this amusing. Lina had nineteen customers that first morning. Some of them had ordinary messages: “I can’t come on Tuesday.” “Buy a pound of potatoes on your way home.” “Please come and fix my front door.” Others had messages that made no sense to her at all, like Mrs. Polster’s. But it didn’t matter. The wonderful part about being a messenger was not the messages but the places she got to go. She could go into the houses of people she didn’t know and hidden alleyways and little rooms in the backs of stores. In just a few hours, she discovered all kinds of strange and interesting things. For instance: Mrs. Sample, the mender, had to sleep on her couch because her entire bedroom, almost up to the ceiling, was crammed with clothes to be mended. Dr. Felinia Tower had the skeleton of a person hanging against her living room wall, its bones all held in place with black strings. “I study it,” she said when she saw Lina staring. “I have to know how people are put together.” At a house on Calloo Street, Lina delivered a message to a worried-looking man whose living room was completely dark. “I’m saving on light bulbs,” the man said. And when Lina took a message to the Can Café, she learned that on certain days the back room was used as a meeting place for people who liked to converse about Great Subjects. “Do you think an Invisible Being is watching over us all the time?” she heard someone ask. “Perhaps,” answered someone else. There was a long silence. “And then again, perhaps not.” All of it was interesting. She loved finding things out, and she loved running. And even by the end of the day, she wasn’t tired. Running made her feel strong and big-hearted, it made her love the places she ran through and the people whose messages she delivered. She wished she could bring all of them the good news they so desperately wanted to hear. Late in the afternoon, a young man came up to her, walking with a sort of sideways lurch. He was an odd-looking person—he had a very long neck with a bump in the middle and teeth so big they looked as if they were trying to escape from his mouth. His black, bushy hair stuck out from his head in untidy tufts. “I have a message for the mayor, at the Gathering Hall,” he said. He paused to let the importance of this be understood. “The mayor,” he said. “Did you get that?” “I got it,” said Lina. “All right. Listen carefully. Tell him: Delivery at eight. From Looper. Repeat it back.” “Delivery at eight. From Looper,” Lina repeated. It was an easy message. “All right. No answer required.” He handed her twenty cents, and she sprinted away. The Gathering Hall occupied one entire side of Harken Square, which was the city’s central plaza. The square was paved with stone. It had a few benches bolted to the ground here and there, as well as a couple of kiosks for notices. Wide steps led up to the Gathering Hall, and fat columns framed its big door. The mayor’s office was in the Gathering Hall. So were the offices of the clerks who kept track of which buildings had broken windows, what streetlamps needed repair, and the number of people in the city. There was the office of the timekeeper, who was in charge of the town clock. And there were offices for the guards who enforced the laws of Ember, now and then putting pickpockets or people who got in fights into the Prison Room, a small one-story structure with a sloping roof that jutted out from one side of the building. Lina ran up the steps and through the door into a broad hallway. On the left was a desk, and at the desk sat a guard: “Barton Snode, Assistant Guard,” said a badge on his chest. He was a big man, with wide shoulders, brawny arms, and a thick neck. But his head looked as if it didn’t belong to his body—it was small and round and topped with a fuzz of extremely short hair. His lower jaw jutted out and moved a little from side to side, as if he were chewing on something. When he saw Lina, his jaw stopped moving for a moment and his lips curled upward in a very small smile. “Good day,” he said. “What business brings you here today?” “I have a message for the mayor.” “Very good, very good.” Barton Snode heaved himself to his feet. “Step this way.” He led Lina down the corridor and opened a door marked “Reception Room.” “Wait here, please,” he said. “The mayor is in his basement office on private business, but he will be up shortly.” Lina went inside. “I’ll notify the mayor,” said Barton Snode. “Please have a seat. The mayor will be right with you. Or pretty soon.” He left, closing the door behind him. A second later, the door opened again, and the guard’s small fuzzy head re-appeared. “What is the message?” he asked. “I have to give it to the mayor in person,” said Lina. “Of course, of course,” said the guard. The door closed again. He doesn’t seem very sure about things, Lina thought. Maybe he’s new at his job. The Reception Room was shabby, but Lina could tell that it had once been impressive. The walls were dark red, with brownish patches where the paint was peeling away. In the right-hand wall was a closed door. An ugly brown carpet lay on the floor, and on it stood a large armchair covered in itchy-looking red material, and several smaller chairs. A small table held a teapot and some cups, and a larger table in the middle of the room displayed a copy of The Book of the City of Ember, lying open as if someone were going to read from it. Portraits of all the mayors of the city since the beginning of time hung on the walls, staring solemnly from behind pieces of old window glass. Lina sat in the big armchair and waited. No one came. She got up and wandered around the room. She bent over The Book of the City of Ember and read a few sentences: “The citizens of Ember may not have luxuries, but the foresight of the Builders, who filled the storerooms at the beginning of time, has ensured that they will always have enough, and enough is all that a person of wisdom needs.” She flipped a few pages. “The Gathering Hall clock,” she read, “measures the hours of night and day. It must never be allowed to run down. Without it, how would we know when to go to work and when to go to school? How would the light director know when to turn the lights on and when to turn them off again? It is the job of the timekeeper to wind the clock every week and to place the date sign in Harken Square every day. The timekeeper must perform these duties faithfully.” Lina knew that not all timekeepers were as faithful as they should be. She’d heard of one, some years ago, who often forgot to change the date sign, so that it might say, “Wednesday, Week 38, Year 227” for several days in a row. There had even been timekeepers who forgot to wind the clock, so that it might stand at noon or at midnight for hours at a time, causing a very long day or a very long night. The result was that no one really knew anymore exactly what day of the week it was, or exactly how many years it had been since the building of the city—they called this the year 241, but it might have been 245 or 239 or 250. As long as the clock’s deep boom rang out every hour, and the lights went on and off more or less regularly, it didn’t seem to matter. Lina left the book and examined the pictures of the mayors. The seventh mayor, Podd Morethwart, was her great-great—she didn’t know how many greats—grandfather. He looked quite dreary, Lina thought. His cheeks were long and hollow, his mouth turned down at the corners, and there was a lost look in his eyes. The picture she liked best was of the fourth mayor, Jane Larket, who had a serene smile and fuzzy black hair. Still no one came. She heard no sounds from the hallway. Maybe they’d forgotten her. Lina went over to the closed door in the right-hand wall. She pulled it open and saw stairs going up. Maybe, while she waited, she’d just see where they went. She started upward. At the top of the first flight was a closed door. Carefully, she opened it. She saw another hallway and more closed doors. She shut the door and kept going. Her footsteps sounded loud on the wood, and she was afraid someone would hear her and come and scold her. No doubt she was not supposed to be here. But no one came, and she climbed on, passing another closed door. The Gathering Hall was the only building in Ember with three stories. She had always wanted to stand on its roof and look out at the city. Maybe from there it would be possible to see beyond the city, into the Unknown Regions. If the bright city of her drawings really did exist, it would be out there somewhere. At the top of the stairs, she came to a door marked “Roof,” and she pushed it open. Chilly air brushed against her skin. She was outside. Ahead of her was a flat gravel surface, and about ten paces away she could see the high wall of the clock tower. She went to the edge of the roof. From there she could see the whole of Ember. Directly below was Harken Square, where people were moving this way and that, all of them appearing, from this top-down view, more round than tall. Beyond Harken Square, the lighted windows of the buildings made checkered lines, yellow and black, row after row, in all directions. She tried to see farther, across the Unknown Regions, but she couldn’t. At the edges of the city, the lights were so far away that they made a kind of haze. She could see nothing beyond them but blackness. She heard a shout from the square below. “Look!” came a small but piercing voice. “Someone on the roof!” She saw a few people stop and look up. “Who is it? What’s she doing up there?” someone cried. More people gathered, until a crowd was standing on the steps of the Gathering Hall. They see me! Lina thought, and it made her laugh. She waved at the crowd and did a few steps from the Bugfoot Scurry Dance, which she’d learned on Cloving Square Dance Day, and they laughed and shouted some more. Then the door behind her burst open, and a huge guard with a bushy black beard was suddenly running toward her. “Halt!” he shouted, though she wasn’t going anywhere. He grabbed her by the arm. “What are you doing here?” “I was just curious,” said Lina, in her most innocent voice. “I wanted to see the city from the roof.” She read the guard’s name badge. It said, “Redge Stabmark, Chief Guard.” “Curiosity leads to trouble,” said Redge Stabmark. He peered down at the crowd. “You have caused a commotion.” He pulled her toward the door and hustled her down all three flights of stairs. When they came out into the waiting room, Barton Snode was standing there looking flustered, his jaw twitching from side to side. Next to him was the mayor. “A child causing trouble, Mayor Cole,” said the chief guard. The mayor glared at her. “I recall your face. From Assignment Day. Shame! Disgracing yourself in your new job.” “I didn’t mean to cause trouble,” said Lina. “I was looking for you so I could deliver a message.” “Shall we put her in the Prison Room for a day or two?” asked the chief guard. The mayor frowned. He pondered a moment. “What is the message?” he said. He bent down so that Lina could speak into his ear. She noticed that he smelled a little like overcooked turnips. “Delivery at eight,” Lina whispered. “From Looper.” The mayor smiled a tight little smile. He turned to the guard. “Just a child’s antics,” he said. “We will let it go this time. From now on,” he said to Lina, “behave yourself.” “Yes, Mr. Mayor,” said Lina. “And you,” said the mayor, turning to the assistant guard and shaking a thick finger at him, “watch visitors much…more…carefully.” Barton Snode blinked and nodded. Lina ran for the door. Outside, the small crowd was still standing by the steps. A few of them cheered as Lina came out. Others frowned at her and muttered words like “mischief” and “silliness” and “show-off.” Lina felt embarrassed suddenly. She hadn’t meant to show off. She hurried past, out into Otterwill Street, and started to run. She didn’t see Doon, who was among those watching her. He had been on his way home from his first day in the Pipeworks when he’d come across the cluster of people gazing up at the roof of the Gathering Hall and laughing. He was tired and chilly. The bottoms of his pants legs were wet, and mud clung to his shoes and smeared his hands. When he raised his eyes and saw the small figure next to the clock tower, he realized right away that it was Lina. He saw her raise her arm and wave and hop about, and for a second he wondered what it would be like to be up there, looking out over the whole city, laughing and waving. When Lina came down, he wanted to speak to her. But he knew he was filthy-looking and that she would ask him questions he didn’t want to answer. So he turned away. Walking fast, he headed for home."
City of Ember Chapter 3,"That morning, Doon had arrived at the Pipeworks full of anticipation. This was the world of serious work at last, where he would get a chance to do something useful. What he’d learned in school, and from his father, and from his own investigations—he could put it all to good purpose now. He pushed open the heavy Pipeworks door and stepped inside. The air smelled strongly of dampness and moldy rubber, which seemed to him a pleasant, interesting smell. He strode up a hallway where yellow slickers hung from pegs on the walls. At the end of the hallway was a room full of people, some of them sitting on benches and pulling on kneehigh rubber boots, some struggling into their slickers, some buckling on tool belts. A raucous clamor filled the room. Doon watched from the doorway, eager to join in but not sure what to do. After a moment a man emerged from the throng. He thrust out a hand. “Lister Munk, Pipeworks director,” he said. “You’re the new boy, right? What size feet do you have— large, medium, or small?” “Medium,” said Doon, and Lister found him a slicker and a pair of boots. The boots were so ancient that their green rubber was cracked all over, as if covered with spiderwebs. He gave Doon a tool belt, too, in which were wrenches and hammers, spools of wire and tape, and tubes of some sort of black goop. “You’ll be in Tunnel 97 today,” Lister said. “Arlin Froll will go down with you and show you what to do.” He pointed at a short, delicate-looking girl with a white-blond braid down her back. “She may not look like an expert, but she is.” Doon buckled his tool belt around his waist and put on his slicker, which, for some reason, smelled like sweaty feet. “This way,” said Arlin, without saying hello or smiling. She wove through the crowd of workers to a door marked “Stairway” and opened it. Stone steps led so far down that Doon couldn’t see the end of them. On either side was a sheer wall of dark reddish stone, glistening with dampness. There was no railing. Along the ceiling ran a single wire from which a light bulb hung every few yards. Water stood in shallow pools on each stair, in the hollow worn into the stones by years of footsteps. They started down. Doon concentrated on his feet—the clumsy boots made it hard not to stumble. As they went deeper, he began to hear a low roar, so low he seemed to hear it more with his stomach than his ears. It grew louder and louder—was it a machine of some kind? Maybe the generator? The stairway came to an end at a door marked “Main Tunnel.” Arlin opened it, and as they stepped through, Doon realized that the sound he had been hearing wasn’t a machine. It was the river. He stood still, staring. Like most people, he had never been really sure what a river was —just that it was water that somehow flowed on its own. He’d imagined it would be like the clear, narrow stream that came out of the kitchen faucet, only bigger, and horizontal instead of vertical. But this was something entirely different—not a stream of water, but endless tons of it pouring by. Wide as the widest street in Ember, churning and dipping and swirling, the river roared past, its turbulent surface like black, liquid glass scattered with flecks of light. Doon had never seen anything that moved so fast, and he had never heard such a thunderous, heart-stopping roar. The path they stood on was about six feet wide and ran parallel to the river for farther than Doon could see in both directions. In the wall along the path were openings that must lead, Doon thought, to the tunnels that branched everywhere below the city. A string of lights like the one in the stairway hung high up against the arched ceiling. Doon knew he was standing beneath the north edge of Ember. In school, you were taught to remember the directions this way: north was the direction of the river; south was the direction of the greenhouses; east was the direction of the school; and west was the direction left over, having nothing in particular to mark it. All the Pipeworks tunnels branched off from the main tunnel to the south, toward the city. Arlin leaned toward Doon and shouted into his ear. “First we’ll go to the beginning of the river,” she said. She led him up the main tunnel for a long way. They passed other people in yellow slickers, who greeted Arlin with a nod and glanced curiously at Doon. After fifteen minutes or so, they came to the east edge of the Pipeworks, where the river surged up from a deep chasm in the ground, churning so violently that its dark water turned white and filled the air with a spray that wet Doon’s face. In the wall to their right was a wide double door. “See that door right there?” Arlin shouted, pointing. “Yes,” Doon shouted back. “That’s the generator room.” “Can we go in?” “Of course not!” said Arlin. “You have to have special permission.” She pointed back down the main tunnel. “Now we’ll go to the end of the river,” she said. She led him back, past the stairway door, all the way to the west edge of the Pipeworks. There the river flowed into a huge opening in the wall and vanished into darkness. “Where does it go?” Doon asked. Arlin just shrugged. “Back into the ground, I guess. Now let’s find Tunnel 97 and get to work.” She pulled a folded piece of paper from her pocket. “This is the map,” she said. “You have one in your pocket, too. You have to use the map to find your way around in here.” The map looked to Doon like an immense centipede—the river arched across the top of the page like the centipede’s body, and the tunnels dangled down from it like hundreds of long, long legs all tangled up with each other. To get to Tunnel 97, they followed a complicated route through passageways lined with crusty, rusted pipes that carried water to all the buildings of Ember. Puddles stood on the floor of the tunnel, and water dripped in brown rivulets down the walls. Just as in the main tunnel, there was a string of bulbs along the ceiling that provided dim light. Doon occupied his mind by calculating how far underground he was. From the river to the ceiling of the main tunnel must be thirty feet or so, he thought. Above that were the storerooms, which occupied a layer at least twenty feet high. So that meant he was fifty feet underground,with tons of earth and rock and buildings above him. The thought made him tense up his shoulders. He cast a quick glance upward, as if all that weight might collapse onto his head. “Here we are,” said Arlin. She was standing next to a leak that spurted a stream of water straight out from the wall. “We have to turn the shut-off valve, take the pipe apart, put on a new connector, and stick it back together again.” With wrenches, hammers, washers, and black goop, they did this, getting soaked in the process. It took them most of the morning and proved to Doon that the city was in even worse shape than he’d suspected. Not only were the lights about to fail and the supplies about to run out, but the water system was breaking down. The whole city was crumbling, and what was anyone doing about it? When the lunch break came, Arlin took her lunch sack from a pocket in her tool belt and went off to meet some friends a few tunnels away. “You stay right here and wait until I get back,” she said as she left. “If you wander around, you’ll get lost.” But Doon set out as soon as she disappeared. Using his map, he found his way back to the main tunnel, then hurried to the east end. He wasn’t going to wait for special permission to see the generator. He was pretty sure he could find a way to get in on his own, and he did. He simply stood by the door and waited for someone to come out. Quite soon, a stout woman carrying a lunch sack pushed open the door and walked away. She didn’t notice him. Before the door could close again, Doon slipped inside. Such a horrendous noise met him that he staggered backward a few steps. It was an earsplitting, growling, grinding, screaming noise, shot through with a hoarse racketyrackety sound and underscored with a deep chugga-chugga-chugga. Doon clapped his hands over his ears and stepped forward. In front of him was a gigantic black machine, two stories high. It was vibrating so hard it looked as if it might explode any second. Several people wearing earmuffs were busy around it. None of them noticed him come in. He tapped one of them on the shoulder, and the person jumped and whirled around. He was an old man, Doon saw, with a deeply lined brown face. “I want to learn about the generator!” Doon screamed, but he might as well have saved his breath. No one could be heard in the uproar. The old man glared at him, made a shooing motion with his hand, and turned back to work. Doon stood and watched for a while. Beside the huge machine were ladders on wheels that the workers pushed back and forth and climbed up on to reach the high parts. All over the room, greasy-looking cans and tools littered the floor. Against the walls stood big bins holding every kind of bolt and screw and gear and lever and rod and tube, all of them black with age and jumbled together. The workers scurried between the bins and the generator or simply stood and watched the thing shake. After a few minutes, Doon left. He was horrified. All his life he had studied how things worked—it was one of his favorite things to do. He could take apart an old watch and put it back together exactly as it had been. He understood how the faucets in the sink worked. He’d fixed the toilet many times. He’d made a wheeled cart out of the parts of an old armchair. He even had a hazy idea of what was going on in the refrigerator. He was proud of his mechanical talent. There was only one thing he didn’t understand at all, and that was electricity. What was the power that ran through the wires and into the light bulbs? Where did it come from? He had thought that if he could just get a look at the generator, he would have the clue he needed. From there, he could begin to work on a solution that would keep the lights of Ember burning. But one glimpse of the generator showed him how foolish he was. He’d expected to see something whose workings he could understand—a wheel turning, a spark being struck, some wires that led from one point to another. But this monstrous roaring thing—he wondered if anyone understood how it worked. It looked as if all they were doing was trying to keep it from flying apart. As it turned out, he was right. When the day was over and he was upstairs taking off his boots and slicker, he saw the old man from the generator room and went to talk to him. “Can you explain to me about the generator?” he asked. “Can you tell me how it works?” The old man just sighed. “All I know is, the river makes it go.” “But how?” The man shrugged. “Who knows? Our job is just to keep it from breaking down. If a part breaks, we got to put on a new one. If a part freezes up, we got to oil it.” He wiped his hand wearily across his forehead, leaving a streak of black grease. “I been working on the generator for twenty years. It’s always managed to chug along, but this year…I don’t know. The thing seems to break down every couple minutes.” He cracked a wry smile. “Of course, I hear we might run out of light bulbs before that, and then it won’t matter if the generator works or not.” Running out of light bulbs, running out of power, running out of time—disaster was right around the corner. That’s what Doon was thinking about when he stopped outside the Gathering Hall on his way home and saw Lina on the roof. She looked so free and happy up there. He didn’t know why she was on the roof, but he wasn’t surprised. It was the kind of thing she did, turning up in unexpected places, and now that she was a messenger, she could go just about anywhere. But how could she be so lighthearted when everything was falling apart? He headed for home. He lived with his father in a two-bedroom apartment over his father’s shop in Greengate Square—the Small Items shop, which sold things like nails, pins, tacks, clips, springs, jar lids, doorknobs, bits of wire, shards of glass, chunks of wood, and other small things that might be useful in some way. The Small Items shop had overflowed somewhat into their apartment above. In their front room, where other people might display a nice teapot on a tabletop or a few attractive squashes or tomatoes on a shelf, they had buckets and boxes and baskets full of spare items for the shop, things Doon’s father had collected but not yet organized for selling. Often these items spilled over onto the floor. It was easy to trip over things in this apartment, and not a good idea to go barefoot. Today Doon didn’t stop in at the shop to see his father before going upstairs. He wasn’t in the mood for conversation. He removed two buckets of stuff from the couch—it looked like mostly shoe heels—and flopped down on the cushions. He’d been stupid to think he could understand the generator just by looking at it, when other people had been working on it their entire lives. The thing was, he had to admit, he’d always thought he was smarter than other people. He’d been sure he could learn about electricity and help save the city. He wanted to be the one to do it. He had imagined many times a ceremony in Harken Square, organized to thank him for saving Ember, with the entire population in attendance and his father beaming from the front row. All Doon’s life, his father had been saying to him, “You’re a good boy and a smart boy. You’ll do grand things someday, I know you will.” But Doon hadn’t done much that was grand so far. He ached to do something truly important, like finding the secret of electricity, and, as his father watched, be rewarded for his achievement. The size of the reward didn’t matter. A small certificate would do, or maybe a badge to sew on his jacket. Now he was stuck in the muck of the Pipeworks, patching up pipes that would leak and break again in a matter of days. It was even more useless and boring than being a messenger. The thought made him suddenly furious. He sat up, grabbed a shoe heel out of the bucket at his feet, and hurled it with all his might. It arrived at the front door just as the door opened. Doon heard a hard thwack and a loud “Ouch!” at the same moment. Then he saw the long, lean, tired-looking face of his father in the doorway. Doon’s anger drained away. “Oh, I hit you, Father. I’m sorry.” Doon’s father rubbed the side of his head. He was a tall man, bald as a peeled potato, with a high forehead and a long chin. He had kind, slightly puzzled gray eyes. “Got me in the ear,” he said. “What was that?” “I got angry for a second,” said Doon. “I threw one of these old heels.” “I see,” said his father. He brushed some bottle tops off a chair and sat down. “Does it have to do with your first day at work, son?” “Yes,” said Doon. His father nodded. “Why don’t you tell me about it,” he said. Doon told him. When he was finished, his father ran a hand across his bald head as if smoothing down the hair that wasn’t there. He sighed. “Well,” he said, “it sounds unpleasant, I have to admit. About the generator, especially—that’s bad news. But the Pipeworks is your assignment, no way around it. What you get is what you get. What you do with what you get, though…that’s more the point, wouldn’t you say?” He looked at Doon and smiled, a bit sadly. “I guess so,” Doon said. “But what can I do?” “I don’t know,” said his father. “You’ll think of something. You’re a clever boy. The main thing is to pay attention. Pay close attention to everything, notice what no one else notices. Then you’ll know what no one else knows, and that’s always useful.” He took off his coat and hung it from a peg on the wall. “How’s the worm?” he asked. “I haven’t looked at it yet,” said Doon. He went into his room and came out with a small wooden box covered with an old scarf. He set the box on the table and took the scarf off, and he and his father both bent over to look inside. A couple of limp cabbage leaves lay on the bottom of the box. On one of the leaves was a worm about an inch long. A few days before school ended, Doon had found the worm on the underside of a cabbage leaf he was slicing up for dinner. It was a pale soft green, velvety smooth all over, with tiny, stubby legs. Doon had always been fascinated by bugs. He wrote down his observations about them in a book he had titled Crawling and Flying Things. Each page of the book was divided lengthwise down the center. On the left he drew his pictures, with a pencil sharpened to a needle-like point: moth wings with their branching patterns of veins; spider legs, which had minute hairs and tiny feet like claws; beetles, with their feelers and their glossy armor. On the right, he wrote what he observed about each creature. He noted what it ate, where it slept, where it laid its eggs, and—if he knew—how long it lived. This was difficult with fast-moving creatures like moths and spiders. To learn anything about them, he had to catch what glimpses he could as they lived their lives out in the open. If he put them in a box, they scrambled around for a few days and then died. This worm, though, was different. It seemed perfectly happy to live in the box Doon had made for it. So far, it did only three things: eat, sleep (it looked like sleeping, though Doon couldn’t tell if the worm closed its eyes—or even if it had eyes), and expel tiny black poop balls. That was it. “I’ve had it for five days now,” said Doon. “It’s twice as big as it was when I got it. It’s eaten two square inches of cabbage leaf.” “You’re writing all this down?” Doon nodded. “Maybe,” said his father, “you’ll find some interesting new bugs in the Pipeworks.” “Maybe,” said Doon. But to himself he said, No, that’s not enough. I can’t go plodding around the Pipeworks, stopping up leaks, looking for bugs, and pretending there’s no emergency. I have to find something important down there, something that’s going to help. I have to. I just have to."
City of Ember Chapter 4,"One day when Lina had been a messenger for several weeks, she came home to find that Granny had thrown all the cushions from the couch onto the floor, ripped up a corner of the couch’s lining, and was pulling out wads of stuffing. “What are you doing?” Lina cried. Granny looked up. Wisps of sofa stuffing stuck to the front of her dress and clung to her hair. “Something is lost,” she said. “I think it might be in here.” “What’s lost, Granny?” “I don’t quite recall,” said the old woman. “Something important.” “But Granny, you’re ruining the couch. What will we sit on?” Granny tore a bit more of the covering off the couch and yanked out another puff of stuffing. “It doesn’t matter,” she said. “I’ll put it back together later.” “Let’s put it back now,” Lina said. “I don’t think what’s lost is in there.” “You don’t know,” said Granny darkly. But she sat back on her heels, looking tired. Lina began cleaning up the mess. “Where’s the baby?” she asked. Granny gazed at Lina blankly. “The baby?” “You haven’t forgotten the baby?” “Oh, yes. She’s…I think she’s down in the shop.” “By herself?” Lina stood up and ran down the stairs. She found Poppy sitting on the floor of the shop, enmeshed in a tangle of yellow yarn. As soon as she saw Lina, Poppy began to howl. Lina picked her up and unwound the yarn, talking soothingly, though she was so upset that her fingers trembled. For Granny to forget the baby was dangerous. Poppy could fall downstairs and hurt herself. She could wander out into the street and get lost. Granny had been forgetful lately, but this was the first time she’d completely forgotten about Poppy. When they got upstairs, Granny was kneeling on the floor gathering up the white tufts of stuffing and jamming them back into the hole she’d made in the couch. “It wasn’t in there,” she said sadly. “What wasn’t?” “It was lost a long time ago,” said Granny. “My father told me about it.” Lina sighed impatiently. More and more, her grandmother’s mind seemed caught in the past. She could explain the rules of pebblejacks, which she’d last played when she was eight, or tell you what happened at the Singing when she was twelve, or who she’d danced with at the Cloving Square Dance when she was sixteen, but she would forget what had happened the day before yesterday. “They heard him talking about it when he died,” she said to Lina. “They heard who talking?” “My grandfather. The seventh mayor.” “And what did they hear him say?” “Ah,” said her grandmother with a faraway look. “That’s the mystery. He said he couldn’t get at it. ‘Now it is lost,’ he said.” “But what was it?” “He didn’t say.” Lina gave up. It didn’t matter anyway. Probably the lost thing was the old man’s left sock, or his hairbrush. But for some reason, the story had taken root in Granny’s mind. The next morning on her way to work, Lina stopped in at the house of their neighbor, Evaleen Murdo. Mrs. Murdo was brisk in her manner, and in her person thin and straight as a nail, but she was kind in her unsmiling way. Until a few years ago, she’d run a shop that sold paper and pencils. But when paper and pencils became scarce, her shop closed. Now she spent her days sitting by her upstairs window, watching people in the street with her sharp eyes. Lina told Mrs. Murdo about her grandmother’s forgetfulness. “Will you look in on her sometimes and make sure things are all right?” she asked. “I will, certainly,” said Mrs. Murdo, nodding twice, firmly. Lina went away feeling better. — That day Lina was given a message by Arbin Swinn, who ran the Callay Street Vegetable Market, to be delivered to Lina’s friend Clary, the greenhouse manager. Lina was glad to carry this message, though her gladness was mixed a little with sadness. Her father had worked in the greenhouses. It still felt strange not to see him there. The five greenhouses produced all of Ember’s fresh food. They were out past Greengate Square, at the farthest edge of the city. Nothing else was out there but the trash heaps, great moldering, stinking hills that stood on rocky ground and were lit by a few floodlights high up on poles. It used to be that no one went to the trash heaps but the trash collectors, who dumped the trash and left it. Now and then a couple of children might go there to play, scrambling up the side of the heaps and tumbling down. Lina and Lizzie used to go when they were younger. They’d pull out the occasional treasure—some empty cans, maybe an old hat or a cracked plate. But not anymore. Now there were guards posted at the trash heaps to make sure no one poked around. Just recently, an official job called trash sifter had been created. Every day a team of people methodically sorted through the trash heaps in search of anything that might be at all useful. They’d come back with broken chair legs that could be used for repairing window frames, bent nails that could become hooks for clothes, even filthy rags, stiff with dirt, that could be washed out and used to patch holes in window blinds or mattress covers. Lina hadn’t thought about it before, but now she wondered about the trash sifters. Were they there because Ember really was running out of everything? Beyond the trash heaps there was nothing at all—that is, only the vast Unknown Regions, where the darkness was absolute. From the end of Diggery Street, Lina could see the long, low greenhouses. They looked like big tin cans that had been cut in half and laid on their sides. Her breath came a little faster. The greenhouses were a home to her, in a way. She knew that she was most likely to find Clary somewhere around Greenhouse 1, where the office was, so that was where she headed first. A small toolshed stood beside the door to Greenhouse 1; Lina peeked into it but saw only rakes and shovels. So she opened the greenhouse door. Warm, furry-smelling air washed over her, and all her love for this place came rushing back. Out of habit, she gazed up toward the ceiling, as if she might see her father there on his ladder, tinkering with the sprinkler system, the temperature gauges, and the lights. The greenhouse light was whiter than the yellowish light of the Ember streetlamps. It came from long tubes that ran the length of the ceiling. In this light, the leaves of the plants shone so green they almost hurt Lina’s eyes. On the days when she’d come here with her father, Lina had spent hours wandering along the gravel paths that ran between the vegetable beds, sniffing the leaves, poking her fingers into the dirt, and learning to tell the plants apart by their look and smell. There were the beans and peas with their curly tendrils, the dark green spinach, the ruffled lettuce, and the hard, pale green cabbages, some of them as big as a newborn baby’s head. What she loved best was to rub the leaves of the tomato plant between her fingers and breathe in their pungent, powdery smell. A long, straight path led from one end of the building to the other. About halfway down the path, Clary was crouching by a bed of carrots. Lina ran toward her, and Clary smiled, brushed the dirt from her hands, and stood up. Clary was tall and solid, with big hands and knobby knuckles. She had a square jaw and square shoulders, and brown hair cut in a short, squarish way. You might have thought from looking at her that she was a gruff, unfriendly person—but her nature was just the opposite. She was more comfortable with plants than with people, Lina’s father had always said. She was strong but shy, a person of much knowledge but few words. Lina had always liked her. Even when she was little, Clary did not treat her like a baby but gave her jobs to do—pulling up carrots, picking bugs off cabbages. Since her parents had died, Lina had come many times to talk to Clary, or just to work silently beside her. Clary was always kind to her, and working with the plants took Lina’s mind off her grief. “Well,” said Clary. She smiled at Lina, wiped her hands on her already grimy pants, and smiled some more. Finally she said, “You’re a messenger.” “Yes,” said Lina, “and I have a message for you. It’s from Arbin Swinn. ‘Please add four extra crates to my order, two of potatoes and two of cabbages.’ ” Clary frowned. “I can’t do that,” she said. “At least, I can send him the cabbages, but only one small crate of potatoes.” “Why?” asked Lina. “Well, we have a sort of problem with the potatoes.” “What is it?” asked Lina. Clary had a habit of answering questions in the briefest possible way. You had to keep asking and asking before she would believe you really wanted to know and weren’t just being polite. Then she would explain, and you could see how much she knew, and how much she loved her work. “I’ll show you,” she said. She led the way to a bed where the green leaves were spotted with black. “A new disease. I haven’t seen it before. When you dig up the potatoes, they’re runny inside instead of hard, and they stink. I’m going to have to throw out all the ones in this bed. There are only a few beds left that aren’t infected.” Most people in Ember had potatoes at every meal—mashed, boiled, stewed, roasted. They’d had fried potatoes, too, in the days before the cooking oil ran out. “I’d hate it if we couldn’t have potatoes anymore,” Lina said. “I would, too,” said Clary. They sat on the edge of the potato bed and talked for a while, about Lina’s grandmother and the baby, about the trouble Clary was having with the beehives, and about the greenhouse sprinkler system. “It hasn’t worked right since…” Clary hesitated and glanced sideways at Lina. “For a long time,” she said. She didn’t want to say “since your father died.” Lina understood that. She stood up. “I should go,” she said. “I have to take Arbin Swinn the answer to his message.” “I hope you’ll come again,” said Clary. “You can come whenever…you can come any time.” Lina said thank you and turned to go. But just outside the greenhouse door, she heard running footsteps and a strange, high, sobbing sound. Or rather, she heard sobs and then a wail, sobs and then a shout, and then more sobs, getting louder. She looked back toward the rear of the greenhouses, toward the trash heaps. “Clary,” she called. “There’s something…” Clary came out and listened, too. “Do you hear it?” “Yes,” said Clary. She frowned. “I’m afraid it’s…it’s someone who…” She peered toward the crying noise. “Yes…here he comes.” Her strong hand gripped Lina’s shoulder for a moment. “You’d better go,” she said. “I’ll take care of this.” “But what is it?” “Never mind. Just go on.” But Lina wanted to see. Once Clary had walked away, she ducked behind the toolshed. From there she watched. The noise came closer. Out beyond the trash heaps, a figure appeared. It was a man, running and stumbling, his arms flopping. He looked as if he was about to fall over, as if he could hardly pick up his feet. In fact, as he came closer he did fall. He tripped over a hose and crumpled to the ground as if his bones had dissolved. Clary stooped down and said something to him in a voice too low for Lina to hear. The man was panting. When he turned over and sat up, Lina saw that his face was scratched and his eyes wide open in fright. His sobs had turned into hiccups. She recognized him. It was Sadge Merrall, one of the clerks in the Supply Depot. He was a quiet, long-faced man who always looked worried. Clary helped him to his feet. The two of them came slowly toward the greenhouse, and as they got closer Lina could hear what the man was saying. He spoke very fast in a weak, trembly voice, hardly stopping for breath. “…was sure I could do it. I said to myself, Just one step after another, that’s all, one step after another. I knew it would be dark. Who doesn’t know that? But I thought, Well, dark can’t hurt you. I’ll just keep going, I thought. …” He stumbled and sagged against Clary. “Careful,” Clary said. They reached the door of the greenhouse, and Clary struggled to open it. Without thinking, Lina darted out from behind the toolshed and opened it for her. Clary shot her a quick frown but said nothing. Sadge didn’t stop talking. “…But then the farther I went the darker it was, and you can’t just keep walking into black dark, can you? It’s like a wall in front of you. I kept turning around to look at the lights of the city, because that’s all there was to see, and then I’d say to myself, Don’t look back, keep moving. But I kept tripping and falling.… The ground is rough out there, I scraped my hands.” He held up one hand and stared at the red scratches on it, which oozed drops of blood. They got him into Clary’s office and sat him down in her chair. He rambled on. “Be brave, I said to myself. I kept going and going, but then all of a sudden I thought, Anything could be out here! There could be a pit a thousand feet deep right in front of me. There could be…something that bites. I’ve heard stories…rats as big as garbage bins…And I had to get out of there. So I turned around and I ran.” “Never mind,” said Clary. “You’re all right now. Lina, get him some water.” Lina found a cup and filled it from the sink in the corner. Sadge took it with a shaking hand and drank it down. “What were you looking for?” Lina asked. She knew what she would have been looking for if she’d gone out there. She’d thought about it countless times. Sadge stared at her. He seemed to have to puzzle over her question. Finally he said, “I was looking for something that could help us.” “What would it be?” “I don’t know. Like a stairway that leads somewhere, maybe. Or a building full of…I don’t know, useful things.” “But you didn’t find anything? Or see anything?” Lina asked, disappointed. “Nothing! Nothing! There is nothing out there!” His voice became a shout and his eyes looked wild again. “Or if there is, we can never get to it. Never! Not without a light.” He took a long, shaky breath. For a while he stared at the floor. Then he stood up. “I think I’m all right now. I’ll be going.” With uncertain steps, he went down the path and out the door. “Well,” said Clary. “I’m sorry that happened while you were here. I was afraid you might be scared, that’s why I told you to go.” But Lina was full of questions, not fear. She had heard tales of people who tried to go out into the Unknown Regions. She had thought about it herself—in fact, she’d wondered the same things as Sadge. She had imagined making her way out into the dark and coming to a wall in which she would find the door to a tunnel, and at the end of the tunnel would be the other city, the city of light that she had dreamed about. All it would take was the courage to walk away from Ember and into the darkness, and then to keep going. It might have been possible if you could carry a light to show the way. But in Ember, there was no such thing as a light you could carry with you. Outside lights were fixed to their poles, or to the roofs of houses; inside lights were set into the ceiling or had cords that had to be plugged in. Over the course of Ember’s history, various clever people had tried to invent a movable light, but all of them had failed. One man had managed to ignite the end of a stick of wood by holding it against the electric burner on his stove. He’d run across the city with the flaming stick, planning to use it to light his journey. But by the time he got to the trash heaps, his torch had gone out. Other people latched on to his idea —one woman who lived on Dedlock Street, very near the edge of the city, managed to get into the Unknown Regions with her flaming stick. But the stick burned quickly, and before she could go far, the flame singed her hands and she threw it down. Everyone who had tried to penetrate the Unknown Regions had come back within a few hours, their enterprise a failure. Lina and Clary stood by the open door of the greenhouse and watched Sadge shuffle toward the city. As he neared the trash heaps, two guards who had been sitting on the ground got to their feet. They walked over to Sadge, and each of them took hold of one of his arms. “Uh-oh,” said Clary. “Those guards are always looking for trouble.” “But Sadge hasn’t broken any law,” said Lina. “Doesn’t matter. They need something to do. They’ll get some fun out of scaring him.” One of the guards was shaking his finger at Sadge and saying something in a voice almost loud enough for Lina to hear. “Poor man,” said Clary with a sigh. “He’s the fourth one this year.” The guards were marching Sadge away now, one on either side of him. Sadge looked limp and small between them. “What do you think is out in the Unknown Regions, Clary?” Clary stared down at the ground, where the light from the greenhouse was casting long, thin shadows of them both. “I don’t know. Nothing, I guess.” “And do you think Ember is the only light in the dark world?” Clary sighed. “I don’t know,” she said. She gave Lina a long look. Her eyes, Lina thought, looked a little sad. They were a deep brown, almost the color of the earth in the garden bed. Clary put a hand in her pocket and drew something out. “Look,” she said. In the palm of her hand was a white bean. “Something in this seed knows how to make a bean plant. How does it know that?” “I don’t know,” said Lina, staring at the hard, flat bean. “It knows because it has life in it,” said Clary. “But where does life come from? What is life?” Lina could see that words were welling up in Clary now; her eyes were bright, her cheeks were rosy. “Take a lamp, for instance. When you plug it in, it comes alive, in a way. It lights up. That’s because it’s connected to a wire that’s connected to the generator, which is making electricity, though don’t ask me how. But a bean seed isn’t connected to anything. Neither are people. We don’t have plugs and wires that connect us to generators. What makes living things go is inside them somehow.” Her dark eyebrows drew together over her eyes. “What I mean is,” she said finally, “something is going on that we don’t understand. They say the Builders made the city. But who made the Builders? Who made us? I think the answer must be somewhere outside of Ember.” “In the Unknown Regions?” “Maybe. Maybe not. I don’t know.” She brushed her hands together in a time-to-getback-to-work way. “Clary,” said Lina quickly, “here’s what I think.” Her heart sped up. She hadn’t told this to anyone before. “In my mind, I see another city.” Lina watched to see if Clary was going to laugh at her, or smile in that overly kind way. She didn’t, so Lina went on. “It isn’t like Ember; it’s white and gleaming. The buildings are tall and sort of sparkle. Everything is bright, not just inside the buildings but all around them, too, even up in the sky. I know it’s just my imagination, but it feels real. I think it is real.” Clary said, “Hmmm,” and then she said, “Where would such a city be?” “That’s what I don’t know. Or how to get to it. I keep thinking there’s a door somewhere, maybe out in the Unknown Regions—a door that leads out of Ember, and then behind the door a road.” Clary just shrugged her shoulders. “I don’t know,” she said. “I have to get back to work. But here—take this.” She handed Lina the bean seed, took a little pot from a shelf, scooped some dirt into it, and handed the pot to Lina, too. “Stick the bean in here and water it every day,” she said. “It looks like nothing, like a little white stone, but inside it there’s life. That must be a sort of clue, don’t you think? If we could just figure it out.” Lina took the seed and the pot. “Thank you,” she said. She wanted to give Clary a hug but didn’t, in case it would embarrass her. Instead, she just said goodbye and raced back toward the city."
City of Ember Chapter 5,"Granny’s mind was getting more and more muddled. Lina would come home in the evenings and find her rifling through the kitchen cupboards, surrounded by cans and jars with their lids off, or tearing the covers off her bed and trying to lift up the mattress with her skinny arms. “It was an important thing,” she would say, “the thing that was lost.” “But if you don’t know what it was,” said Lina, “how will you know when you’ve found it?” Granny didn’t try to answer this question. She just flapped her hands at Lina and said, “Never mind, never mind, never mind,” and kept on searching. These days, Mrs. Murdo spent a great deal of time sitting by their window rather than her own. She would tell Granny she was just coming to keep her company. “I don’t want her to keep me company,” Granny complained to Lina, and Lina said, “Maybe she’s lonely, Granny. Let her come.” Lina rather liked having Mrs. Murdo around—it was a bit like having a mother there. She wasn’t anything like Lina’s own mother, who had been a dreamy, absent-minded sort of person. Mrs. Murdo was mother-like in quite a different way. She made sure they all ate a good breakfast in the morning—usually potatoes with mushroom gravy and beet tea. She lined up the vitamin pills by each person’s plate and made sure they were swallowed. When Mrs. Murdo was there, shoes got picked up and put away, spills were wiped off the furniture, and Poppy always had on clean clothes. Lina could relax when Mrs. Murdo was around. She knew things were taken care of. Every week, Lina—like all workers between age twelve and age fifteen—had Thursday off. One Thursday, as she was standing in line at the Garn Square market, hoping to get a bag of turnips for stew that night, she overheard a startling conversation between two people standing behind her. “What I wanted,” said one voice, “was some paint for my front door. It hasn’t been painted for years. It’s gray and peeling, horrible. I heard a store over on Night Street had some. I was hoping for blue.” “Blue would be nice,” said the other voice wistfully. “But when I got there,” the first voice continued, “the man said he had no paint, never had. Disagreeable man. All he had were a few colored pencils.” Colored pencils! Lina had not seen colored pencils in any store for ages. Once she’d had two red ones, a blue one, and a brown one. She’d used these for her drawing until they were stubs too small to hold. Now she had only one plain pencil left, and it was rapidly growing shorter. She longed to have colored pencils for her pictures of the imaginary city. She had a feeling it was a colorful place, though she didn’t know what its colors might be. There were other things, of course, on which her money would be better spent. Granny’s only coat was full of holes and coming apart at the seams. But Granny rarely went out, Lina told herself. She was either at home or in her yarn shop. She didn’t really need a new coat, did she? Besides, how much could a few pencils cost? She could probably get a coat for Granny and some pencils. So that afternoon she set out for Night Street. She took Poppy with her. Poppy had learned how to ride piggyback—she wrapped her legs around Lina’s waist and gripped Lina’s throat with her small, strong fingers. On Budloe Street, people were standing in long lines with their bundles of laundry at the washing stations. The washers stirred the clothes in the washing machines with long poles. In days past, the machines themselves had whirled the clothes around, but not one of them worked anymore. Lina turned up Hafter Street, where the four streetlamps were still out and a building crew was repairing a partly collapsed roof. Orly Gordon called out to her from high on a ladder, and Lina looked up and waved. Farther on, she passed a woman with bits of rope and string for sale and a man pulling a cart full of carrots and beets to the grocery stores. At the corner, a cluster of little children played catch with a rag ball. The streets were alive with people today. Moving fast, Lina threaded her way among them. But as she went into Otterwill Street, she saw something that made her slow down. A man was standing on the steps of the Gathering Hall, shouting and howling, and a crowd of people had gathered around him. Lina went closer, and when she saw who it was, her insides gave a lurch. It was Sadge Merrall. His arms flailed wildly, and his eyes were stretched wide open. In a high, rapid voice, he wailed out a stream of words: “I have been to the Unknown Regions!” he cried. “There is nothing, nothing, nothing there! Did you think something out there might save us? Ha! There’s only darkness and monsters, darkness and terrible deep holes, darkness forever! The rats are the size of houses! The rocks are sharp as knives! The darkness sucks your breath out! No hope for us out there, oh no! No hope, no hope!” He went on like this for a few minutes and then crumpled to the ground. The people watching him looked at each other and shook their heads. “Gone mad,” Lina heard someone say. “Yes, completely,” said someone else. Suddenly Sadge sprang up again and resumed his terrible shouting. The crowd stepped back. Some of them hurried away. A few of them approached Sadge, speaking in calming voices. They took him by the arms and led him, still shouting, down the steps. “Who dat? Who dat?” said Poppy in her small, piercing voice. Lina turned away from the miserable spectacle. “Hush, Poppy,” she said. “It’s a poor, sad man. He doesn’t feel good. We mustn’t stare.” She headed toward Night Street, which ran along Greengate Square. There a stringyhaired man sat cross-legged on the ground playing a flute made out of a drainpipe, and five or six Believers circled him, clapping and singing. “Soon, soon, coming soon,” they sang. What’s coming soon? Lina wondered, but she didn’t stop to ask. Two blocks beyond, she came to a store that had no sign in its window. This must be the one, she thought. At first it looked closed. Its window was dark. But the door opened when she pushed on it, and a bell attached to its doorknob clanked. From the back room came a black-haired man with big teeth and a long neck. “Yes?” he said. Lina recognized him. He was the one who’d given her the message for the mayor on her very first day of work. His name was Hooper—no, Looper, that was it. “Do you have pencils for sale?” she asked. It seemed doubtful. The shop’s shelves were empty except for a few stacks of used paper. Poppy squirmed on Lina’s back and whimpered a little. “Sometimes,” said Looper. Poppy’s whimper became a wail. “All right, you can get down,” Lina said to her. She set her on the floor, where she tottered about unsteadily. “What I’d like to see,” said Lina, “are your colored pencils. If you have any.” “We have a few,” said Looper. “They are somewhat expensive.” He smiled, showing his pushy teeth. “Could I see them?” said Lina. He went into the back room and returned a moment later, carrying a small box, which he set down on the counter. He took the lid off. Lina bent forward to look. Inside the box were at least a dozen colored pencils—red, green, blue, yellow, purple, orange. They had never even been sharpened; their ends were flat. They had erasers. Lina’s heart gave a few fast beats. “How much are they?” she said. “Probably too much for you,” the man said. “Probably not,” said Lina. “I have a job.” “Good, good,” the man said, smiling again. “No need to take offense.” He picked up the yellow pencil and twirled it between his fingers. “Each pencil,” he said, “five dollars.” Five dollars! For seven, you could buy a coat—it would be an old, patched coat, but still warm. “That’s too much,” Lina said. He shrugged and began to put the lid back on the box. “But maybe…” Lina’s thoughts raced. “Let me look at them again.” Once more the man lifted the lid and Lina bent over the pencils. She picked one up. It was painted a deep clear blue, and on its flat top was the blue dot of the lead. The pink eraser was held on by a shiny metal collar. So beautiful! I could buy just one, Lina thought. Then I could save a little more and buy a coat for Granny next month. “Make up your mind,” said the man. “I have other customers who are interested, if you aren’t.” “All right. I’ll take one. No, wait.” It was like hunger, what she felt. It was the same as when her hand sometimes seemed to reach out by itself to grab a piece of food. It was too strong to resist. “I’ll take two,” she said, and a faint, dazzly feeling came over her at the thought of what she was doing. “Which two?” the man said. There were more colors in that box of pencils than in all of Ember. Ember’s colors were all so much the same—gray buildings, gray streets, black sky; even the colors of people’s clothes were faded from long use into mud green, and rust red, and gray-blue. But these colors—they were as bright as the leaves and flowers in the greenhouse. Lina’s hand hovered over the pencils. “The blue one,” she said. “And…the yellow one— no, the…the…” The man made an impatient noise in the back of his throat. “The green one,” said Lina. “I’ll take the blue and the green.” She lifted them out of the box. She took the money from the pocket of her coat and handed it to the man, and she put the pencils in her pocket. They were hers now; she felt a fierce, defiant joy. She turned to go, and that was when she saw that the baby was no longer in the store. “Poppy!” she cried. She whirled around. “Did you see my little sister go out?” she asked the man. “Did you see which way she went?” He shrugged. “Didn’t notice,” he said. Lina darted into the street and looked in both directions. She saw lots of people, some children, but no Poppy. She stopped an old woman. “Have you seen a little girl, a baby, walking by herself? In a green jacket, with a hood?” The old woman just stared at her with dull eyes and shook her head. “Poppy!” Lina called. “Poppy!” Her voice rose to a shout. Such a little baby couldn’t have gone far, she thought. Maybe down toward Greengate Square, where there were more people walking around. She began to run. And then the lights flickered, and flickered again, and went out. Darkness slammed up in front of her like a wall. She stumbled, caught herself, and stood still. She could see absolutely nothing. Shouts of alarm came from up and down the street, and then silence. Lina stretched her arms out. Was she facing the street or a building? Terror swept through her. I must just stand still, she thought. The lights will come on again in a few seconds, they always do. But she thought of Poppy alone in the blackness, and her legs went weak. I must find her. She took a step. When she didn’t bump into anything, she took another step, and the fingers of her right hand crumpled against something hard. The wall of a building, she thought. Keeping her hand against it, she turned left a little and took another step forward. Then suddenly her hand touched empty air. This would be Dedlock Street. Or had she passed Dedlock Street already? She couldn’t keep the picture of the streets clear in her mind. The darkness seemed to fill not just the city around her but the inside of her head as well. Heart pounding, she waited. Come back, lights, she pleaded. Please come back. She wanted to call out to Poppy, to tell her to stand still, not to be afraid, she would come for her soon. But the darkness pressed against her and she couldn’t summon her voice. She could hardly breathe. She wanted to claw the darkness away from her eyes, as if it were someone’s hands. Small sounds came from here and there around her—a whimpering, a shuffling. In the distance someone called out incoherently. How many minutes had gone by? The longest blackout ever had been three minutes and fourteen seconds. Surely this was longer. She could have endured it if she’d been on her own. It was the thought of Poppy, lost, that she couldn’t stand—and lost because she had been paying more attention to a box of pencils. Oh, she’d been selfish and greedy, and now she was so, so sorry! She made herself take another step forward. But then she thought, What if I’m going away from Poppy? She began to tremble, and she felt the sinking and dissolving inside her that meant she was going to cry. Her legs gave way like wet paper and she slid down until she was sitting on the street, with her head on her knees. Trembling, her mind a wordless whirl of dread, she waited. An endless time went by. A moan came from somewhere to the left. A door slammed closed. Footsteps started, then stopped. Into Lina’s mind floated the beginning of the worst question: What if the lights never …? She squeezed her arms around her knees and made the question stop. Lights come back, she said to herself. Lights come back, come back. And suddenly they did. Lina sprang up. There was the street again, and people looking upward with their mouths hanging open. All around, people started crying or wailing or grinning in relief. Then all at once everyone started to hurry, moving fast toward the safety of home in case it should happen again. Lina ran toward Greengate Square, stopping everyone she passed. “Did you see a little girl walking by herself just before the lights went out?” she asked. “Green jacket with a hood?” But no one wanted to listen to her. On the Bee Street side of the square stood a few people all talking at once and waving their arms. Lina ran up to them and asked her question. They stopped talking and stared at her. “How could we have seen anyone? The lights were out,” said Nammy Proggs, a tiny old woman whose back was so bent that she had to twist her head sideways to look up. Lina said, “No, she wandered away before the lights went out. She got away from me. She may have come this direction.” “You have to keep your eye on a baby,” Nammy Proggs scolded. “Babies need watching,” said one of the women who’d been singing with the Believers. But someone else said, “Oh, a toddler? Green jacket?” and he walked over to an open shop door and called, “You have that baby in there?” and through the door came someone leading Poppy by the hand. Lina dashed to her and lifted her up. Poppy broke into loud wails. “You’re all right now,” said Lina, holding her tightly. “Don’t worry, sweetie. You were just lost a moment, now you’re all right. I’ve got you, don’t worry.” When she looked up to thank the person who’d found her, she saw a face she recognized. It was Doon. He looked the same as when she’d last seen him, except that his hair was shaggier. He had on the same baggy brown jacket he always wore. “She was marching up the street by herself,” he said. “No one knew who she belonged to, so I took her into my father’s shop.” “She belongs to me,” Lina said. “She’s my sister. I was so afraid when she was lost. I thought she might fall and hurt herself, or be knocked over, or…Anyway, thank you so much for rescuing her.” “Anyone would have,” said Doon. He frowned and looked down at the pavement. Poppy had calmed down and was curled up against Lina’s chest with her thumb in her mouth. “And your job—how is it?” Lina asked. “The Pipeworks?” Doon shrugged his shoulders. “All right,” he said. “Interesting, anyway.” She waited, but it seemed that was all he was going to say. “Well, thank you again,” she said. She hoisted Poppy around to her back. “Lucky for you Doon Harrow was around,” said Nammy Proggs, who’d been watching them with her sideways glare. “He’s a good-hearted boy. Anything breaks at my house, he fixes it.” She hobbled after Lina, shaking a finger at her. “You’d better watch that baby more carefully,” she called. “You shouldn’t leave her alone,” the flute player added. “I know,” said Lina. “You’re right.” When she got home, she put the tired baby to bed in the bedroom they shared. Granny had been taking an afternoon nap in the front room and hadn’t noticed the blackout at all. Lina told her that the lights had gone out for a few minutes, but she didn’t mention anything about Poppy getting lost. Later, in her bedroom, with Poppy asleep, she took the two colored pencils from her pocket. They were not quite as beautiful as they had been. When she held them, she remembered the powerful wanting she had felt in that dusty store, and the feeling of it was mixed up with fear and shame and darkness."
City of Ember Chapter 6,"It was strange how people didn’t talk much about the blackout. Power failures usually aroused lively discussion, with clumps of people collecting on corners and saying to each other, “Where were you when it happened?” and “What’s the matter with the electricians, we should kick them out and get new ones,” and that sort of thing. This time, it was just the opposite. When Lina went to work the next morning, the street was oddly silent. People walked quickly, their eyes on the ground. Those who did stop to talk spoke in low voices, then hurried on their way. That day, Lina carried the same message twelve times. All the messengers were carrying it. It was simply this, being passed from one person to another: Seven minutes. The power failure had been more than twice as long as any other so far. Fear had settled over the city. Lina felt it like a cold chill. She understood now that Doon had been speaking the truth on Assignment Day. Ember was in grave danger. The next day a notice appeared on all the city’s kiosks: TOWN MEETING ALL CITIZENS ARE REQUESTED TO ASSEMBLE IN HARKEN SQUARE AT 6 P.M. TOMORROW TO RECEIVE IMPORTANT INFORMATION. MAYOR LEMANDER COLE What kind of important information? Lina wondered. Good news or bad? She was impatient to hear it. The next day, people streamed into Harken Square from all four directions, crowding together so close that each person hardly had room to move. Children sat on the shoulders of fathers. Short people tried to push toward the front. Lina spotted Lizzie and called a greeting to her. She saw Vindie Chance, too, who had brought her little brother. Lina had decided to leave Poppy at home with Granny. There was too much danger of losing her in a crowd like this. The town clock began to strike. Six vibrating bongs rang out, and a murmur of anticipation swept through the crowd. People stood on tiptoe, craning to see. The door of the Gathering Hall opened, and the mayor came out, flanked by two guards. One of the guards handed the mayor a megaphone, and the mayor began to speak. His voice came through the megaphone both blurry and crackly. “People of Ember,” he said. He waited. The crowd fell silent, straining to hear. “People of Ember,” the mayor said again. He looked from side to side. The light glinted off his bald head. “Our city has experienced some slight diffcushlaylie. Times like this require gresh peshn frush all.” “What did he say?” people whispered urgently. “What did he say? I couldn’t hear him.” “Slight difficulties,” someone said. “Requires great patience from us all.” “But I stand here today,” the mayor went on, “to reassure you. Difficult times will pass. We are mayg effn effuff.” “What?” came the sharp whisper. “What did he say?” Those near the front passed word back. “Making every effort,” they said. “Every effort.” “Louder!” someone shouted. The mayor’s voice blared through the megaphone louder but even less clear. “Wursh poshuling!” he said. “Pank. Mushen pank. No rrrshen pank.” “We can’t hear you!” someone else yelled. Lina felt a stirring around her, a muttering. Someone pushed against her back, forcing her forward. “He said we mustn’t panic,” someone said. “He said panic is the worst possible thing. No reason to panic, he said.” On the steps of the Gathering Hall, the two guards moved a little closer to the mayor. He raised the megaphone and spoke again. “Slooshns!” he bellowed. “Arbingfoun!” “Solutions,” the people in front called to the people in back. “Solutions are being found, he said.” “What solutions?” called a woman standing near Lina. People elsewhere in the crowd echoed what the woman had said. “What solutions? What solutions?” Their cry became a chorus, louder and louder. Again Lina felt the pressure from behind as people moved forward toward the Gathering Hall. Jostling arms poked her, bulky bodies bumped her and crushed her. Her heart began to pound. I have to get out of here! she thought. She started ducking beneath arms and darting into whatever space she could find, making her way toward the rear of the crowd. Noise was rising everywhere. The mayor’s voice kept coming in blasts of incomprehensible sound, and the people in the crowd were either shouting angrily or yelping in fear of being squashed. Someone stepped on Lina’s foot, and her scarf was half yanked off. For a few seconds she was afraid she was going to be trampled. But at last she struggled free and ran up onto the steps of the school. From there she saw that the two guards were hustling the mayor back through the door of the Gathering Hall. The crowd roared, and a few people started hurling whatever they could find—pebbles, garbage, crumpled paper, even their own hats. At the other side of the square, Doon and his father battled their way down Gilly Street. “Move fast,” his father said. “We don’t want to be caught up in this crowd.” They crossed Broad Street and took the long way home, through the narrow lanes behind the school. “Father,” said Doon as they hurried along, “the mayor is a fool, don’t you think?” For a moment his father didn’t answer. Then he said, “He’s in a tough spot, son. What would you have him do?” “Not lie, at least,” Doon said. “If he really has a solution, he should have told us. He shouldn’t pretend he has solutions when he doesn’t.” Doon’s father smiled. “That would be a good start,” he agreed. “It makes me so angry, the way he talks to us,” said Doon. Doon’s father put a hand on Doon’s back and steered him toward the corner. “A great many things make you angry lately,” he said. “For good reason,” said Doon. “Maybe. The trouble with anger is, it gets hold of you. And then you aren’t the master of yourself anymore. Anger is.” Doon walked on silently. Inwardly, he groaned. He knew what his father was going to say, and he didn’t feel like hearing it. “And when anger is the boss, you get—” “I know,” said Doon. “Unintended consequences.” “That’s right. Like hitting your father in the ear with a shoe heel.” “I didn’t mean to.” “That’s exactly my point.” They walked on down Pibb Street. Doon shoved his hands into the pockets of his jacket and scowled at the sidewalk. Father doesn’t even have a temper, he thought. He’s as mild as a glass of water. He can’t possibly understand. — Lina was running. She’d already dismissed the mayor’s speech from her mind. She sped by people on Otterwill Street going back to open their stores and overheard snatches of conversation as she passed. “Expects us to believe…,” said one voice. “He’s just trying to keep us quiet,” said another. “Heading for disaster…,” said a third. All the voices shook with anger and fear. Lina didn’t want to think about it. Her feet slapped the stones of the street, her hair flew out behind her. She would go home, she would make hot potato soup for the three of them, and then she would take out her new pencils and draw. She climbed the stairs next to the yarn shop two at a time and burst through the door of the apartment. Something was on the floor just in front of her feet, and she tripped and fell down hard on her hands and knees. She stared. By the open closet door was a great pile of coats and boots and bags and boxes, their contents all spilled out and tangled up. A thumping and rattling came from inside the closet. “Granny?” More thumps. Granny’s head poked around the edge of the closet door. “I should have looked in here a long time ago,” she said. “This is where it would be, of course. You should see what’s in here!” Lina gazed around at the incredible mess. Into this closet had been packed the junk of decades, jammed into cardboard boxes, stuffed into old pillowcases and laundry bags, and heaped up in a pile so dense that you couldn’t pull one thing out without pulling all the rest with it. The shelf above the coatrack was just as crammed as the space below, mostly with old clothes that were full of moth holes and eaten away by mildew. When she was younger, Lina had tried exploring in this closet, but she never got far. She’d pull out an old scarf that would fall to pieces in her hands, or open a box that proved to be full of bent carpet tacks. Soon she would shove everything back in and give up. But Granny was really doing the job right. She grunted and panted as she wrenched free the closet’s packed-in stuff and tossed it behind her. It was clear that she was having fun. As Lina watched, a bag of rags came tumbling out the door, and then an old brown shoe with no laces. “Granny,” said Lina, suddenly uneasy. “Where’s the baby?” “Oh, she’s here!” came Granny’s voice from the depths of the closet. “She’s been helping me.” Lina got up from the floor and looked around. She soon spotted Poppy. She was sitting behind the couch, in the midst of the clutter. In front of her was a small box made of something dark and shiny. It had a hinged lid, and the lid was open, hanging backward. “Poppy,” said Lina, “let me see that.” She stooped down. There was some sort of mechanism on the edge of the lid—a kind of lock, Lina thought. The box was beautifully made, but it had been damaged. There were dents and scratches in its hard, smooth surface. It looked as if it had been a container for something valuable. But the box was empty now. Lina picked it up and felt around in it to be sure. There was nothing inside at all. “Was there something in this box, Poppy? Did you find something in here?” But Poppy only chortled happily. She was chewing on some crumpled paper. She had paper in her hands, too, and was tearing it. Shreds of paper were strewn around her. Lina picked one up. It was covered with small, perfect printing."
City of Ember Chapter 7,"It was the printing that sparked Lina’s curiosity. It was not handwriting, or if it was, it was the neatest, most regular handwriting she had ever seen. It was more like the letters printed on cans of food or along the sides of pencils. Something other than a hand had written those words. A machine of some kind. This was the writing of the Builders. And so this piece of paper must have come from the Builders, too. Lina gathered up the scraps of paper from the floor and gently pried open Poppy’s fists and mouth to extract the crumpled wads. She put all this into the dented box and carried it to her room. That evening, Granny and the baby were both asleep by a little after eight. Lina had nearly an hour to examine her discovery. She took the scraps from the box and spread them out on the table in her bedroom. The paper was thick; at each torn edge was a fringe of tangled fibers. There were many little pieces and one big piece with so many holes that it was like lace. The chewed bits were beyond saving—they were almost a paste. But Lina spread out the big lacy piece and saw that on one edge of it, which was still intact, was a column of numbers. She collected all the dry scraps and puzzled over them for a long time, trying to figure out where they fit into the larger piece. When she had arranged them as well as she could, this was what she had: Lina could make sense of only a few words here and there. Even so, something about this tattered document was exciting. It was not like anything Lina had ever seen. She stared at the very first word at the top of the page, “Instru,” and she suddenly knew what it must be. She’d seen it often enough at school. It had to be the beginning of “Instructions.” Her heart began knocking at her chest like a fist at a door. She had found something. She had found something strange and important: instructions for something. But for what? And how terrible that Poppy had found it first and ruined it! It occurred to Lina that this might be what her grandmother had been talking about for so long. Perhaps this was the thing that was lost. But of course not knowing what had been lost, Granny wouldn’t have recognized the box when she saw it. She would have tossed it out of the closet just as carelessly as she tossed everything else. Anyhow, it didn’t matter whether this was the thing or not the thing. It was a mystery in itself, whatever it was, and Lina was determined to solve it. The first step was to stick the scraps of paper down. They were so light that a breath could scatter them. She had a little bit of glue left in an old bottle. Painstakingly, she put a dot of glue on each of the scraps and pressed each one into its place on one of her precious few remaining whole sheets of paper. She put another piece of paper on top of this and set the box on top to flatten everything down. Just as she finished, the lights went out—she’d forgotten to keep an eye on the clock on her windowsill. She had to undress and get in bed in the dark. She was too excited to sleep much that night. Her mind whirled around, trying to think what the message she’d found might be. She felt sure it had something to do with saving the city. What if these instructions were for fixing the electricity? Or for making a movable light? That would change everything. When the lights went on in the morning, she had a few minutes before Poppy wakened to work at the puzzle. But there were so many words missing! How could she ever make sense of such a jumble? As she pulled on her red jacket and tied the frayed and knotted laces of her shoes, she thought about it. If the paper was important, she shouldn’t keep it to herself. But who could she tell? Maybe the messenger captain. She would know about things like official documents. “Captain Fleery,” Lina said when she got to work, “would you have time to come home with me later on today? Just for a minute? I found something I’d like to show you.” “Found what?” asked Captain Fleery. “Some paper with writing on it. I think it might be important.” Captain Fleery raised her skinny eyebrows. “What do you mean, important?” “Well, I’m not sure. Maybe it isn’t. But would you look at it anyway?” So that evening Captain Fleery came home with Lina and peered at the bits of paper. She bent down and inspected the writing. “Foll?” she said. “Acks? Rem? Ont? What kind of words are those?” “I don’t know,” said Lina. “The words are all broken up because Poppy chewed on them.” “I see,” said Captain Fleery. She poked at the paper. “This looks like instructions for something,” she said. “A recipe, I suppose. ‘Small steel pan’—that would be what you use to cook it with.” “But who would have such small, perfect writing?” “That’s the way they wrote in the old days,” said Captain Fleery. “It could be a very old recipe.” “But then why would it have been kept in this beautiful box?” She showed the box to Captain Fleery. “I think it was locked up in here for some reason, and you wouldn’t lock up something unless it was important.…” But Captain Fleery didn’t seem to have heard her. “Or,” she said, “it could be a school exercise. Someone’s homework that never got turned in.” “But have you ever seen paper like this? Doesn’t it look as if it came from someplace else—not here?” Captain Fleery straightened up. A look of puzzlement came over her face. “There is nowhere but here,” she said. She put both her hands on Lina’s shoulders. “You, my dear, are letting your imagination run away with you. Are you overtired, Lina? Are you anxious? I could put you on short days for a while.” “No,” said Lina, “I’m fine. I am. But I don’t know what to do about…” She gestured toward the paper. “Never mind,” said Captain Fleery. “Don’t think about it. Throw it away. You’re worrying too much—I know, I know, we all are, there’s so much to worry about, but we mustn’t let it unsettle us.” She gave Lina a long look. Her eyes were the color of dishwater. “Help is coming,” she said. “Help?” “Yes. Coming to save us.” “Who is?” Captain Fleery bent down and lowered her voice, as if telling a secret. “Who built our city, dear?” “The Builders,” said Lina. “That’s right. And the Builders will come again and show us the way.” “They will?” “Very soon,” said Captain Fleery. “How do you know?” Captain Fleery straightened up again and clapped a hand over her heart. “I know it here,” she said. “And I have seen it in a dream. So have all of us, all the Believers.” So that’s what they believe, Lina thought—and Captain Fleery is one of them. She wondered how the captain could feel so sure about it, just because she’d seen it in a dream. Maybe it was the same for her as the sparkling city was for Lina—she wanted it to be true. The captain’s face lit up. “I know what you must do, dear—come to one of our meetings. It would lift your heart. We sing.” “Oh,” said Lina, “thank you, but I’m not sure I…maybe sometime…” She tried to be polite, but she knew she wouldn’t go. She didn’t want to stand around waiting for the Builders. She had other things to do. Captain Fleery patted her arm. “No pressure, dear,” she said. “If you change your mind, let me know. But take my advice: forget about your little puzzle project. Lie down and take a nap. Clears the mind.” Her narrow face beamed kindness down at Lina. “You take tomorrow off,” she said. She raised a hand goodbye and went down the stairs. Lina took advantage of her day off to go to the Supply Depot to see Lizzie Bisco. Lizzie was quick and smart. She might have some good ideas. At the Supply Depot, crowds of shopkeepers stood in long, disorderly lines that stretched out the door. They pushed and jostled and snapped impatiently at each other. Lina joined them, but they seemed so frantic that they frightened her a little. They must be very sure now that the supplies are running out, she thought, and they’re determined to get what they can before it’s too late. When she got close to the head of the line, she heard the same conversation several times. “Sorry,” the clerk would say when a shopkeeper asked for ten packets of sewing needles, or a dozen drinking glasses, or twenty packages of light bulbs. “There’s a severe shortage of that item. You can have only one.” Or else the clerk would say, “Sorry. We’re out of that entirely.” “Forever?” “Forever.” Lina knew that it hadn’t always been this way. When Ember was a young city, the storerooms were full. They held everything the citizens could want—so much it seemed the supplies would never run out. Lina’s grandmother had told her that schoolchildren were given a tour of the storerooms as part of their education. They took an elevator from the street level to a long, curving tunnel with doors on both sides and other tunnels branching off it. The guide led the tour down the long passages, opening one door after another. “This area,” he would say, “is Canned Goods. Next we come to School Supplies. And around this bend we have Kitchenware. Next come Carpentry Tools.” At each door, the children crowded against each other to see. “Every room had something different,” Granny told Lina. “Boxes of toothpaste in one room. Bottles of cooking oil. Bars of soap. Boxes of pills—there were twenty rooms just for vitamin pills. One room was stacked with hundreds of cans of fruit. There was something called pineapple, I remember that one especially.” “What was pineapple?” asked Lina. “It was yellow and sweet,” said Granny with a dreamy look in her eyes. “I had it four times before we ran out of it.” But these tours had been discontinued long before Lina was born. The storerooms, people said, were no longer a pleasure to look at. Their dusty shelves stood mostly empty now. It was rumored that in some rooms nothing was left at all. A child seeing the rooms where powdered milk had been stored, or the rooms that stored bandages or socks or pins or notebooks, or—most of all—the dozens of rooms that had once held thousands of light bulbs—would not feel, as earlier generations of children had, that Ember was endlessly rich. Today’s children, if they were to tour the storerooms, would feel afraid. Thinking about all this, Lina waited in the line of people at Lizzie’s station. When she got to the front, she leaned forward with her elbows on the counter and whispered, “Lizzie, can you meet me after you’re through with work? I’ll wait for you right outside the door.” Lizzie nodded eagerly. At four o’clock, Lizzie came trotting out the office door. Lina said to her, “Will you come home with me for a minute? I want to show you something.” “Sure,” said Lizzie, and as they walked, Lizzie talked. “My wrist is killing me from writing all day,” she said. “You have to write in the tiniest letters to save paper, so I get a terrible cramp in my wrist and my fingers. And people are so rude. Today they were worse than ever. I said to some guy, ‘You can’t have fifteen cans of corn, you can only have three,’ and he said, ‘Look, don’t tell me that, I saw plenty of cans in the Pott Street market just yesterday,’ and I said, ‘Well, that’s why there aren’t so many left today,’ and he said, ‘Don’t be smart with me, carrot-head.’ But what am I supposed to do? I can’t make cans of corn out of thin air.” They passed through Harken Square, around the Gathering Hall, and down Roving Street, where three of the floodlights were out, making a cave of shadow. “Lizzie,” said Lina, interrupting the flow of talk. “Is it true about light bulbs?” “Is what true?” “That there aren’t very many left?” Lizzie shrugged. “I don’t know. They hardly ever let us go downstairs into the storerooms. All we see are the reports the carriers turn in—how many forks in Room 1146, how many doorknobs in 3291, how many children’s shoes in 2249 …” “But when you see the report for the light bulb rooms, what does it say?” “I never get to see that one,” said Lizzie. “That one, and a few other ones like the vitamin report, only a few people can see.” “Who?” “Oh, the mayor, and of course old Flab Face.” Lina looked at her questioningly. “You know, Farlo Batten, the head of the storerooms. He is so mean, Lina, you would just hate him. He counts us late if we come in even two minutes after eight, and he looks over our shoulders as we’re writing, which is awful because he has bad breath, and he runs his finger over what we’ve written and says, ‘This word is illegible, that word is illegible, these numbers are illegible.’ It’s his favorite word, illegible.” When they came to Lina’s street, Lina ducked her head in the door of the yarn shop and said hello to Granny, and then they climbed the stairs to the apartment. Lizzie was talking about how hard it was to stand up all day, how it made her knees ache, how her shoes pinched her feet. She stopped talking long enough to say hello to Evaleen Murdo, who was sitting by the window with Poppy on her lap, and then she began again as Lina led her into her bedroom. “Lina, where were you when the big blackout came?” she asked, but she went right on without waiting for an answer. “I was at home, luckily. But it was scary, wasn’t it?” Lina nodded. She didn’t want to talk about what had happened that day. “I hate those blackouts,” Lizzie went on. “People say there’s going to be more and more of them, and that someday—” She stopped, frowned, and started again. “Anyway, nothing bad happened to me. After that, I got up and figured out a whole new way to do my hair.” It seemed to Lina that Lizzie was like a clock wound too tightly and running too fast. She’d always been a little this way, but today she was more so than ever. Her gaze skipped from one spot to another, her fingers twiddled with the edge of her shirt. She looked paler than usual, too. Her freckles stood out like little smudges of dirt on her nose. “Lizzie,” said Lina, beckoning toward the table in the corner of her room. “I want to show you—” But Lizzie wasn’t listening. “You’re so lucky to be a messenger, Lina,” she said. “Is it fun? I wish I could have been one. I would have been so good at it. My job is so boring.” Lina turned and looked at her. “Isn’t there anything you like about it?” Lizzie pursed her lips in a tiny smile and looked sideways at Lina. “There’s one thing,” she said. “What?” “I can’t tell you. It’s a secret.” “Oh,” said Lina. Then you shouldn’t have mentioned it at all, she thought. “Maybe I’ll tell you someday,” said Lizzie. “I don’t know.” “Well, I like my job,” Lina said. “But what I wanted to talk to you about was what I found yesterday. It’s this.” She lifted the box away and took up the piece of paper covering the patched-together document. Lizzie gave it a quick look. “Is it a message someone gave you? That got torn up?” “No, it was in our closet. Poppy was chewing on it, that’s why it’s torn up. But look at the writing on it. Isn’t it strange?” “Uh-huh,” said Lizzie. “You know who has beautiful handwriting? Myla Bone, who works with me. You should see it, it’s got curly tails on the y’s and the g’s, and fancy loops on the capital letters. Of course Flab Face hates it, he says it’s illegible.…” Lina slid the piece of paper back over the pasted-down scraps. She wondered why she had thought Lizzie would be interested in what she’d found. She’d always had fun with Lizzie. But their fun was usually with games—hide-and-seek, tag, the kinds of games where you run and climb. Lizzie never had been much interested in anything that was written on paper. So Lina quietly put the document back in its place, and she sat down with Lizzie on the floor. She listened and listened until Lizzie’s chatter ran down. “I’d better go,” Lizzie said. “It was fun to see you, Lina. I miss you.” She stood up. She fluffed her hair. “What was it you wanted to show me? Oh, yes—the fancy writing. Really nice. Lucky you to find it. Come and see me again soon, all right? I get so bored in that office.” Lina made beet soup for dinner that night, and Poppy spilled hers and made a red lake on the table. Granny stared into her bowl, stirring and stirring the soup with her spoon, but she didn’t eat. She didn’t feel quite right, she told Lina; after a while she wandered off to bed. Lina cleaned up the kitchen quickly. As soon as her chores were out of the way, she could get back to studying her document. She washed Poppy’s clothes. She sewed on the buttons that had come off her messenger jacket. She picked up the rags and sacks and boxes and bags that Granny had tossed out of the closet. And by the time she had done all this and put Poppy to bed, she still had almost half an hour to study the fragments of paper. She sat down at her desk and uncovered the document. With her elbows on either side of it and her chin resting in her hands, she pored over it. Though Lizzie and Captain Fleery had paid it no attention, Lina still thought this torn-up page must be important. Why else would it have been in such a cleverly fastened box? Maybe she should show it to the mayor, she thought reluctantly. She didn’t like the mayor. She didn’t trust him, either. But if this document was important to the future of the city, he was the one who should know about it. Of course, she couldn’t ask the mayor to come to her house. She pictured him puffing up the stairs, squeezing through the door, looking disapprovingly at the clutter in their house, recoiling from Poppy’s sticky hands—no, it wouldn’t do. But she didn’t want to take her carefully patched-together document to the Gathering Hall, either. It was just too fragile. The best thing to do, she decided, was to write the mayor a note. She settled down to do this. She found a fairly unspoiled half-piece of paper, and, using a plain pencil (she wasn’t going to waste her colored ones on the mayor), she wrote: Dear Mayor Cole, I have discovered a document that was in the closet. It is Instructions for something. I believe it is important because it is written in very old printing. Unfortunately it got chewed up by my sister, so it is not all there. But you can still read some bits of it, such as: marked with E find door of bo small steel pan I will show you this document if you want to see it. Sincerely yours, Lina Mayfleet, Messenger 34 Quillium Square She folded the note in half and wrote “Mayor Cole” on the front. On her way to work the next morning, she took it to the Gathering Hall. No one was sitting at the guard’s desk, so Lina left the note there, placed so that the guard would see it when he arrived. Then, feeling that she had done her duty, she went off to her station. — Several days went by. The messages Lina carried were full of worry and fear. “Do you have any extra Baby Drink? I can’t find it at the store.” “Have you heard what they’re saying about the generator?” “We can’t come tonight—Grandpa B. won’t get out of bed.” Every day when she got home from work, Lina asked Granny, “Did a message come for me?” But there was nothing. Maybe the mayor hadn’t gotten her note. Maybe he’d gotten it and paid no attention. After a week, Lina decided she was tired of waiting. If the mayor wasn’t interested in what she’d found, too bad for him. She was interested. She would figure it out herself. Twice during the week, when Poppy and Granny were both asleep, she’d had a little free time. She’d spent this time making a copy of the document, in case anything happened to the fragile original. It had taken her a long time. She used one of her few remaining pieces of paper—an old label, slightly torn, from a can of peas. The copy was as accurate as she could make it, with the missing bits between the letters carefully indicated as dashes. She had tucked it under the mattress of her bed for safekeeping. Now she finally had a whole free evening. Poppy and Granny were both asleep, and the apartment was tidy. Lina sat down at her table and uncovered the patched-together document. She tied back her hair so it wouldn’t keep falling in her face, and she put a piece of paper next to her—blank except for a little bit of Poppy’s scribbling—to write down what she decoded. She started with the title. The first word she’d already figured out. It had to be “Instructions.” The next word could be “for.” Then came “Egres”—she wasn’t sure about that. Maybe it was someone’s name. Egresman. Egreston. “Instructions for Egreston.” She decided to call it “The Instructions” for short. She went on to the first line. “This offic doc” probably meant “This official document.” Maybe “secur” meant “secure.” Or “security.” Then there were the words “period” and “ears” and “city.” But after that, so much was missing. She studied the line next to the number 1. Exp. That could be Expect or Expert or so many things. She moved on to riv. That might be part of a word like “drive” or “strive.” What could ip and ork possibly be? They were so close together, maybe they were part of one word. What ended with -ip? Whip, Lina thought. Trip. Slip. What ended with -ork? Fork came to mind immediately. Tripfork. Slipfork. Nothing she could think of made sense. Maybe it wasn’t fork. What else ended in -ork? Starting at the beginning of the alphabet, Lina went through all the words that rhymed with fork. Most of them were nonsense: bork, dork, gork, hork, jork.… This isn’t going to work, she thought miserably. Oh…work! The word could be work. Then what would the first part be? Tripwork? Flipwork? But maybe there was a letter between the p and the w. Dipswork? Pipswork? Suddenly it came to her. Pipeworks. Pipeworks! That had to be it. Something in this message was about the Pipeworks! Lina looked back at Exp and riv. Riv! That could be river! Rapidly she ran her eyes down the page. In line 3, she saw iverb nk—that looked like riverbank. The word door jumped out at her from line 4, whole on its scrap of paper. Lina took a quick breath. A door! What if it was the one she’d wished for, the one that led to the other city? Maybe her city was real after all, and these were instructions for finding it! She wanted to leap from her chair and shout. The message had something to do with the river, a door, and the Pipeworks. And who did she know who knew about the Pipeworks? Doon, of course. She pictured his thin, serious face, and his eyes looking out searchingly from beneath his dark eyebrows. She pictured how he used to bend over his work at school, holding his pencil in a hard grip, and how, during free time, he was usually off by himself in a corner studying a moth or a worm or a taken-apart clock. That was one thing, at least, that she liked about Doon: he was curious. He paid attention to things. And he cared about things, too. She remembered how he’d been on Assignment Day, so furious at the mayor, so eager to trade his good job for her bad one so he could help save the city. And he’d taken Poppy inside his father’s shop on the day of the blackout so she wouldn’t be afraid. Why had she stopped being friends with Doon? She vaguely recalled the incident of the light pole. It seemed silly now, and long ago. The more she thought about Doon, the more it seemed he was the very person—the only person—who might be interested in what she had found. She placed the plain sheet of paper over the Instructions and put the box on top. I’ll go and find Doon, she thought. Tomorrow was Thursday—their day off. She would find him tomorrow and ask for his help."
City of Ember Chapter 8,"Doon had taken to wandering the Pipeworks alone. He would go to his assigned tunnel and do his job quickly—once you got good at using your wrenches and brushes and tubes of glue, it wasn’t hard. Most of the workers did their jobs quickly and then gathered in little groups to play cards or have salamander races or just talk and sleep. But Doon didn’t care about any of that. If he was going to be stuck in the Pipeworks, he would at least not waste the time he had. Since the long blackout, everything seemed more urgent than ever. Whenever the lights flickered, he was afraid the ancient generator might be shuddering to a permanent halt. So while the others lounged around, he headed out toward the edges of the Pipeworks to see what he could see. “Pay attention,” his father had said, and that’s what he did. He followed his map when he could, but in some places the map was unclear. There were even tunnels that didn’t show up on the map at all. To keep from getting lost, he dropped a trail of things as he walked—washers, bolts, pieces of wire, whatever he had in his tool belt—and then he picked them up on his way back. His father had been at least a little bit right: there were interesting things in the Pipeworks if you paid attention. Already he had found three new crawling creatures: a black beetle the size of a pinhead, a moth with furry wings, and the best of all, a creature with a soft, shiny body and a small, spiral-patterned shell on its back. Just after he found this one, while he was sitting on the floor watching in fascination as the creature crept up his arm, a couple of workers came by and saw him. They burst into laughter. “It’s bugboy!” one of them said. “He’s collecting bugs for his lunch!” Enraged, Doon jumped up and shouted at them. His sudden motion made the creature fall off his arm to the ground, and Doon felt a crunch beneath his foot. The laughing workers didn’t notice—they tossed a few more taunts at him and walked on—but Doon knew instantly what he’d done. He lifted his foot and looked at the squashed mess underneath. Unintended consequences, he thought miserably. He was angry at his anger, the way it surged up and took over. He picked the bits of shell and goo off the sole of his boot and thought, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to hurt you. In the days that followed, Doon went farther and farther into the Pipeworks, holding on to the hope that he might find something not only interesting but important. But what he found didn’t seem important at all. Once he came upon an old pair of pliers that someone had dropped and left behind. Twice he found a coin. He discovered a supply closet that appeared to have been completely forgotten, but all it held were some boxes of plugs and washers and a rusty box containing shriveled bits of what must once have been someone’s lunch. He found another supply closet at the far south end of the Pipeworks—at least, he assumed that’s what it was. It was at the end of a tunnel with a rope strung across it; a sign hanging from the rope said, “Caved In. No Entry.” Doon entered anyway, ducking under the rope. He found no sign of a cave-in, but there were no lights. He groped his way forward for twenty steps or so, and there the tunnel ended in a securely locked door—he couldn’t see it, but he felt it. He retraced his steps, ducked back under the rope again, and walked on. A short distance away, he found a hatch in the ceiling of the tunnel—a square wooden panel that must lead, he thought, up into the storerooms. If he’d had something to stand on, he could have reached it and tried to open it, but it was about a foot above his upstretched hand. Probably it was locked anyhow. He wondered if the Builders had used openings like this one during the construction of the city to get more easily from one place to another. On days when his job was near the main tunnel, he sometimes walked along the river after he’d finished working. He stayed away from the east end, where the generator was; he didn’t want to think about the generator. Instead, he went the other way, toward the place where the river rushed out of the Pipeworks. The path grew less level at this end, and less smooth. The river here was bordered with clumps of wrinkled rock that seemed to grow out of the ground like fungus. Doon liked to sit on these clumps, running his fingers along the strange creases and crevices that must have been carved somehow by running or dripping water. In some places there were grooves that looked almost like writing. But as for things of importance, Doon found none. It seemed that the Pipeworks was no use after all to a person who wanted to save the city. The generator was hopeless. He would never understand electricity. He used to think he could use electricity to invent a movable light, if he studied hard enough. He took apart light bulbs; he took apart the electric outlets on the wall to see how the wires inside wound together and, in the process, got a painful, vibrating jolt all through his body. But when he tried to wind wires of his own together in exactly the same way, nothing happened. It was what came through the wires that made the light, he finally understood, and he had no idea what that was. Now he could see only two courses of action: he could give up and do nothing, or he could start to work on a different kind of movable light. Doon didn’t want to give up. So on his day off one Thursday, he went to the Ember Library to look up fire. The library occupied an entire building on one side of Bilbollio Square. Its door was at the end of a short passage in the middle of the building. Doon went down the passage, pushed open the door, and walked in. No one was there except for the librarian, ancient Edward Pocket, who sat behind his desk writing something with a tiny pencil clutched in his gnarled hand. The library had two big rooms, one for fiction, which was stories people made up out of their imaginations, and the other for fact, which was information about the real world. The walls of both rooms were lined with shelves, and on most of the shelves were hundreds of packets of pages. Each packet was held together with stout loops of string. The packets leaned against each other at angles and lay in untidy stacks. Some were thick, and some were so slim that only a clip was needed to hold them together. The pages of the oldest packets were yellowed and warped, and their edges were uneven rows of ripples. These were the books of Ember, written over the years by its citizens. They contained in their close-written pages much that was imagined and everything that was known. Edward Pocket looked up and nodded briefly at Doon, one of his most frequent visitors. Doon nodded back. He went into the fact room, to the section of shelves labeled “F.” The books were arranged by subject, but even so, it wasn’t easy to find what you wanted. A book about moths, for instance, might be under “M” for moths, or “I” for insects, or “B” for bugs. It might even be under “F” for flying things. Usually you had to browse through the entire library to make sure you’d found all the books on one subject. But since he was looking for “fire,” he thought he might as well start with “F.” Fire was rare in Ember. When there was a fire, it was because there had been an accident—someone had left a dishtowel too close to an electric burner on a stove, or a cord had frayed and a spark had flown out and ignited curtains. Then the citizens would rush in with buckets of water, and the fire was quickly drowned. But it was, of course, possible to start a fire on purpose. You could hold a sliver of wood to the stove burner until it burst into flame, and then for a moment it would flare brightly, giving off orange light. The trick was to find a way to make the light last. If you had a light that would keep going, you could go out into the Unknown Regions and see what was there. Finding a way to explore the Unknown Regions was the only thing Doon could think of to do. He took down a book from the “F” shelf. Fungus, it was called. He put it back. The next book was called How to Repair Furniture. He put that back, too. He went through Foot Diseases, Fun with String, Coping with Failure, and Canned Fruit Recipes before he finally found a book called All About Fire. He sat down at one of the library’s square tables to read it. But the person who had written the book knew no more about fire than Doon. Mostly the book described the dangers of fire. A long section of it was about a building in Winifred Square that had caught fire forty years ago, and how all its doors and all its furniture had burned up and smoke had filled the air for days. Another part was about what to do if your oven caught on fire. Doon closed the book and sighed. It was useless. He could write a better book than that. He got up and wandered restlessly around the library. Sometimes you could find useful things just by choosing randomly from the shelves. He had done this many times—just reached out and grabbed something—in the hope that by accident he might come upon the very piece of information he needed. It would be something that another person had written down without understanding its significance, just a sentence or two that would be like a flash of light in Doon’s mind, fitting together with things he already knew to make a solution to everything. Although he’d often found something interesting in these searches, he’d never found anything important. Today was no different. He did come across a collection called Mysterious Words from the Past, which he read for a while. It was about words and phrases so old that their meanings had been forgotten. He read a few pages. Heavens above Indicates surprise. What “heavens” means is unclear. It might be another word for “floodlight.” Hogwash Means “nonsense,” though no one knows what a “hog” is or why one would wash it. Batting a thousand Indicates great success. This might possibly refer to killing bugs. All in the same boat Means “all in the same predicament.” The meaning of “boat” is unknown. Interesting, but not useful. He put the book back on the shelf and was about to leave when the door of the library opened, and Lina Mayfleet came in."
City of Ember Chapter 9,"Lina saw Doon immediately—he was reaching up to set a book back on its shelf. He saw her, too, when he turned around, and his dark eyebrows flew up in surprise as she hurried over to him. “Your father told me you were here,” she said. “Doon, I found something. I want to show it to you.” “To me? Why?” “I think it’s important. It has to do with the Pipeworks. Will you come to my house and see it?” “Now?” Doon asked. Lina nodded. Doon grabbed his old brown jacket and followed Lina out of the library and across the city to Quillium Square. Granny’s shop was closed and dark when they arrived, and so Lina was surprised when they went upstairs and saw Evaleen Murdo sitting in her place by the window. “Your grandmother’s in her bedroom,” Mrs. Murdo said. “She didn’t feel well, so she asked me to come.” Poppy was sitting on the floor, banging a spoon on the leg of a chair. Lina introduced Doon, then led him into the room she shared with Poppy. He looked around, and Lina felt suddenly self-conscious, seeing her room through his eyes. It was a small room with a lot crammed into it. There were two narrow beds, a very small table that fit into a corner, and a four-legged stool to sit on. On the wall, clothes hung from hooks, and more clothes were strewn untidily on the floor. Beneath the window was a brown stain made by the bean seed in its pot on the windowsill. Lina had been watering it every night because she’d promised Clary she would, but it was still nothing but dirt, flat and unpromising. A couple of shelves beside the window held Lina’s important possessions: the pieces of paper she’d collected for drawing, her pencils, a scarf with a silver thread woven through it. On the parts of the wall that had no hooks and no shelves, she had pinned up some of her pictures. “What are those?” Doon asked. “They’re from my imagination,” Lina said, feeling slightly embarrassed. “They’re pictures of…another city.” “Oh. You made it up.” “Sort of. Sometimes I dream of it.” “I draw, too,” said Doon. “But I draw other kinds of things.” “Like what?” “Mostly insects,” said Doon. He told her about his collection of drawings and the worm he was currently observing. To Lina, this sounded far less interesting than an undiscovered city, but she didn’t say so. She led Doon over to the table. “Here’s what I want to show you,” she said. She lifted the metal box. Before she could reach for the papers underneath, Doon took the box and started examining it. “Where did this come from?” he asked. “It was in the closet,” Lina said. She told him about Granny’s wild search and about finding the box with its lid open and Poppy with paper in her mouth. As she talked, Doon turned the box over in his hands, opened and closed its lid, and peered at the latch. “There’s some sort of odd mechanism here,” he said. He tapped at a small metal compartment at the front of the box. “I’d like to see inside this.” “Here’s what was in the box,” said Lina, lifting the covering paper from her patchwork of scraps. “At least, it’s what’s left of what was in there.” Doon bent over, his hands on either side of the paper. Lina said, “It’s called ‘Instructions for Egreston.’ Or maybe ‘Egresman.’ Someone’s name, anyhow. Maybe a mayor, or a guard. I just call it ‘The Instructions.’ I told the mayor about it—I thought maybe it was important. I wrote him a note, but he hasn’t answered. I don’t think he’s interested.” Doon said nothing. “You don’t have to hold your breath,” said Lina. “I glued the pieces down. Look,” she said, pointing. “This word must be Pipeworks. And this one river. And look at this one —door.” Doon didn’t answer. His hair had fallen forward, so Lina couldn’t see the expression on his face. “I thought at first,” Lina went on, “that it must be instructions for how to do something. How to fix the electricity, maybe. But then I thought, What if it’s instructions for going to another place?” Doon said nothing, so Lina went on. “I mean someplace that isn’t here, like another city. I think these instructions say, ‘Go down into the Pipeworks and look for a door.’ ” Doon brushed the hair back from his face, but he didn’t straighten up. He gazed at the broken words and frowned. “Edge,” he murmured. “Small steel pan. What would that mean?” “A frying pan?” said Lina. “But I don’t know why there’d be a frying pan in the Pipeworks.” But Doon didn’t answer. He seemed to be talking to himself. He kept reading, moving a finger along the lines of words. “Open,” he whispered. “Follow.” Finally he turned to look at Lina. “I think you’re right,” he said. “I think this is important.” “Oh, I was sure you’d think so!” Lina cried. She was so relieved that her words poured out in a rush. “Because you take things seriously! You told the truth to the mayor on Assignment Day. I didn’t want to believe it, but then came the long blackout, and I knew— I knew things were as bad as you said.” She stopped, breathless. She pointed to a word on the document. “This door,” she said. “It has to be a door that leads out of Ember.” “I don’t know,” said Doon. “Maybe. Or a door that leads to something important, even if it isn’t that.” “But it must be that—what else could be important enough to lock up in a fancy box?” “Well…I suppose it could be a storage room with some special tools in it or something —” A look of surprise came over his face. “Actually, I saw a door where I didn’t expect to see one—out in Tunnel 351. It was locked. I thought it was an old supply closet. I wonder if that could be it.” “It must be!” cried Lina. Her heart sped up. “It wasn’t anywhere near the river,” Doon said doubtfully. “That doesn’t matter!” Lina said. “The river goes through the Pipeworks, that’s all. It’s probably something like, ‘Go down by the river, then go this way, then that way …’ ” “Maybe,” said Doon. “It must be!” Lina cried. “I know it is! It’s the door that leads out of Ember.” “I don’t know if that makes sense,” said Doon. “A door in the Pipeworks could only lead to something underground, and how could that…” Lina had no patience for Doon’s reasoning. She wanted to dance around the room, she was so excited. “We have to find out,” she said. “We have to find out right away!” Doon looked startled. “Well, I can go and try the door again,” he said. “It was locked before, but I suppose…” “I want to go, too,” said Lina. “You want to come down into the Pipeworks?” “Yes! Can you get me in?” Doon thought for a moment. “I think I can. If you come just at quitting time and wait outside the door, I’ll stay out of sight until everyone has gone, and then I’ll let you in.” “Tomorrow?” “Okay. Tomorrow.” — Lina stopped at home the next day only long enough to change out of her messenger jacket, and then she dashed across town to the Pipeworks. Doon met her just outside the door, and she followed him inside, where he handed her a slicker and boots to put on. They descended the long stone stairway, and when they came out into the main tunnel, Lina stood still, staring at the river. “I didn’t know the river was so big,” she said, after she found her voice. “Yes,” said Doon. “Every few years, they say, someone falls in. If you fall in, there’s no hope of fishing you out. The river swallows you and sweeps you away.” Lina shivered. It was cold down here, a cold that she felt all the way through, cold flesh, cold blood, cold bones. Doon led her up the path beside the water. After a while they came to an opening in the wall, and they turned into it and left the river behind. Doon led the way through winding tunnels. Their rubber boots splashed in pools of water on the floor. Lina thought how awful it would be to work down here all day, every day. It was a creepy place, a place where it seemed people didn’t belong. That black river…it was like something in a bad dream. “You have to duck here,” said Doon. They had come to a roped-off tunnel. “But there’s no light in there,” Lina said. “No,” said Doon. “We have to feel our way. It isn’t far.” He ducked under the rope and went in, and Lina did the same. They stepped forward into the dark. Lina kept a hand against the damp wall and placed her feet carefully. “It’s right here,” said Doon. He had stopped a few feet ahead of Lina. She came up behind him. “Put your hands out,” he said. “You’ll feel it.” Lina felt a smooth, hard surface. There was a round metal knob, and below the knob, a keyhole. It seemed an ordinary door—not at all like the entrance to a new world. But that was what made things so exciting—nothing was ever how you expected it to be. “Let’s try it,” she whispered. Doon took hold of the knob and twisted. “Locked,” he said. “Is there a pan anywhere?” “A pan?” “The instructions said ‘small steel pan.’ Maybe that would have the key in it.” They felt around, but there was nothing—just the rocky walls. They patted the walls, they put their ears to the door, they jiggled the knob and pulled it and pushed it. Finally Doon said, “Well, we can’t get in. I guess we’d better go.” And that was when they heard the noise. It was a scuffling, scraping noise that seemed to be coming from somewhere nearby. Lina stopped breathing. She clutched Doon’s arm. “Quick,” Doon whispered. He made his way back toward the lighted tunnel, with Lina following. They ducked under the rope and rounded a turn, then stopped, stood still, and listened. A harsh scraping sound. A thud. A pause…and then the sound of an impact, a short, explosive breath, and a muttered word in a gruff, low voice. Then slow footsteps, getting closer. They flattened themselves against the wall and stood motionless. The footsteps stopped briefly, and there was another grunt. Then the steps continued, but seemed to be fading. In a moment, from a distance, there was another sound: the chink of a key turning in a lock, and the click of a latch opening. Lina made an astonished face at Doon. Someone had gone down the roped tunnel and opened the door! She put her mouth close to Doon’s ear. “Shall we try to see who it is?” she whispered. Doon shook his head. “I don’t think we should,” he said. “We should go.” “We could just peek around the corner.” It was too tempting not to try. They crept forward to the place where the tunnel turned. From there they could see the entrance to the roped tunnel. Holding their breath, they watched. And in a minute, they heard a thump and click—the door closing, the lock turning—and footsteps once again, this time quick. A long leg stepped over the rope, and the person it belonged to turned and walked away. All they saw was his back—a dark coat, dark untidy hair. He walked with a lurching motion that struck Lina as somehow familiar. In a few seconds, he had vanished into the shadows. — When they came up out of the Pipeworks, they stripped off their boots and slickers and hurried out into Plummer Square, where they flopped down on a bench and burst into furious talk. “Someone got there before us!” said Lina. Doon said, “He was walking slowly when he went in—as if he was looking for something. And he walked fast when he came out…” “As if he’d found something! What was it? I can’t stand not to know!” Doon jumped up. He paced back and forth in front of the bench. “But how did he get the key?” he asked. “Did he find Instructions like the ones you found? And how did he get into the Pipeworks? I don’t think he works there.” “There’s something familiar about the way he walks,” said Lina. “But I don’t know why.” “Well, anyhow, he opened that door and we can’t,” said Doon. “If it does go somewhere, if it does lead out of Ember, he’ll be telling the whole city pretty soon. He’ll be a hero.” Doon sat down again. “If he’s found the way out, we’ll be glad, of course,” he said glumly. “It doesn’t matter who finds it, as long as it helps the city.” “That’s right,” Lina said. “It’s just that I thought we were going to find it,” said Doon. “Yes,” Lina said, thinking how grand it would have been to stand before all of Ember, announcing their discovery. They sat without talking for a while, lost in their own thoughts. A man pulling a cart full of wood scraps went by. A woman leaned from a lighted window on Gappery Street and called out to some boys playing in the square below. A couple of guards, in their red and brown uniforms, ambled across the square, laughing. The town clock rang out six deep booms that Lina could feel, like shudders, beneath her ribs. Doon said, “I guess what we do now is wait to see if there’s an announcement.” “I guess so,” said Lina. “Maybe that door is nothing special after all,” said Doon. “Maybe it’s just an old unused supply closet.” But Lina wasn’t ready to believe that. Maybe it wasn’t the door out of Ember, but it was a mystery nevertheless—a mystery connected, she was sure, to the bigger mystery they were trying to solve."
City of Ember Chapter 10,"Lina slept restlessly that night. She had frightening dreams in which something dangerous was lurking in the darkness. When the lights went on in the morning and she opened her eyes, her first thought was of the door in the Pipeworks—and then right away she felt a thud of disappointment, because the door was locked and someone else, not her, knew what was behind it. She went in to wake Granny. “Time to get up,” she said, but Granny didn’t answer. She was lying with her mouth half open and breathing in a strange hoarse way. “Don’t feel too good,” she finally said in a weak voice. Lina felt Granny’s forehead. It was hot. Her hands were very cold. She ran for Mrs. Murdo and after that to Cloving Square to tell Captain Fleery she would not be coming to work today. Then she ran to Oliver Street, to the office of Dr. Tower, where she banged on the door until the doctor opened it. Dr. Tower was a thin woman with uncombed hair and shadows under her eyes. When she saw Lina, she seemed to grow even more tired. “Dr. Tower,” Lina said, “my grandmother is sick. Will you come?” “I will,” she said. “But I can’t promise to help her. I’m low on medicine.” “But come and look. Maybe she doesn’t need medicine.” Lina led the doctor the few blocks to her house. When she saw Granny, the doctor sighed. “How are you, Granny Mayfleet?” she asked. Granny looked at the doctor blearily. “I think ill,” she said. Dr. Tower laid a hand across her forehead. She asked her to stick out her tongue, and she listened to her heart and her breathing. “She has a fever,” the doctor told Lina. “You’ll need to stay home with her today. Make her some soup. Give her water to drink. Put rags in cool water and lay them across her forehead.” She picked up Granny’s bony hand in her rough, reddish one. “What’s best for you is to sleep today,” she said. “Your good granddaughter will take care of you.” And all day, that’s what Lina did. She made a thin soup of spinach and onions and fed it to Granny a spoonful at a time. She stroked Granny’s forehead, held her hand, and talked to her about cheerful things. She kept Poppy as quiet as she could. But as she did all this, in the back of her mind was the memory of the days of her father’s illness, when he seemed to grow dim like a lamp losing power, and the sound of his breathing was like water gurgling through a clogged pipe. Though she didn’t want to, she also remembered the evening when her father let out one last short breath and didn’t take another, and the morning a few months later when Dr. Tower emerged from her mother’s bedroom with a crying baby and a face that was heavy with bad news. In the late afternoon, Granny got restless. She lifted herself up on one elbow. “Did we find it?” she asked Lina. “Did we ever find it?” “Find what, Granny?” “The thing that was lost,” Granny said. “The old thing that my grandfather lost…” “Yes,” said Lina. “Don’t worry, Granny, we found it, it’s safe now.” “Oh, good.” Granny sank back onto her pillows and smiled at the ceiling. “What a relief,” she said. She coughed a couple of times, closed her eyes, and fell asleep. Lina stayed home from work the next day as well. It was a long day. Granny dozed most of the time. Poppy, delighted to have Lina at home to play with, kept toddling over with things she found—dust rags, kitchen spoons, stray shoes—and whacking them against Lina’s knees, saying, “Play wif dis! Play wif dis!” Lina was glad to play with her, but after a while she’d had enough of spoon-banging and rag-tugging and shoe-rolling. “Let’s do something else,” she said to Poppy. “Shall we draw?” Granny had drunk a full cup of soup for dinner and was falling asleep again, so Lina got out her colored pencils and two of the can labels she’d been saving—they were white on the back and made good enough drawing paper, if you flattened them out. With their sharpest kitchen knife, she whittled the pencils into points. She gave the green pencil and one can label to Poppy, and she herself took the blue pencil and smoothed out the other can label on the table. What would she draw? Taking hold of a pencil was like opening a tap inside her mind through which her imagination flowed. She could feel the pictures ready to come out. It was a sort of pressure, like water in a pipe. She always thought she would draw something wonderful, but what she actually drew never quite matched the feeling. It was like when she tried to tell a dream—the words never really captured how it felt. Poppy was grasping the pencil in her fist and making a wild scribble. “Lookit!” she cried. “Lovely,” said Lina. Then, without even a clear idea of what it was to be, she began her own picture. She started on the left side of the can label. First she drew a tall, narrow box —a building. Then more boxes next to it—a cluster of buildings. Next she drew a few tiny people walking on the street below the buildings. It was what she nearly always drew—the other city—and every time she drew it, she had the same frustrating feeling: there was more to be drawn. There were other things in this city, there were marvels there—but she couldn’t imagine what they were. All she knew was that this city was bright in a different way from Ember. Where the brightness came from she didn’t know. She drew more buildings and filled in the windows and doors; she put in streetlamps; she added a greenhouse. All the way across the paper, she drew buildings of different sizes. All the buildings were white, because that was the color of the paper. She set her pencil down for a moment and studied what she’d done. It was time to fill in the sky. In the pictures she’d done with regular pencils, the sky was its true color, black. But this time she made it blue, since she was using her blue pencil. Methodically, as Poppy scratched and scribbled beside her, Lina colored in the space above the buildings, her pencil moving back and forth in short lines, until the entire sky was blue. She sat back and looked at her picture. Wouldn’t it be strange, she thought, to have a blue sky? But she liked the way it looked. It would be beautiful—a blue sky. Poppy had started using her pencil to poke holes in her paper. Lina folded up her own picture and took Poppy’s away from her. “Time for dinner,” she said. — Sometime deep in the night, Lina woke suddenly, thinking she’d heard something. Had she been dreaming? She lay still, her eyes open in the darkness. The sound came again, a weak, trembling call: “Lina…” She got up and started for Granny’s room. Though she had lived in the same house all her life, she still had trouble finding her way at night, when the darkness was complete. It was as if walls had shifted slightly, and furniture moved to new places. Lina stayed close to the walls, feeling her way along. Here was her bedroom door. Here was the kitchen and the table—she winced as she stubbed her toe on one of its legs. A little farther and she’d come to the far wall and the door to Granny’s room. Granny’s voice was like a thin line in the dark air. “Lina…Come and help…I need…” “I’m coming, Granny,” she called. She stumbled over something—a shoe, maybe—and fell against the bed. “Here I am, Granny!” she said. She felt for Granny’s hand—it was very cold. “I feel so strange,” said Granny. Her voice was a whisper. “I dreamed…I dreamed about my baby…or someone’s baby…” Lina sat down on the bed. Carefully she moved her hands over the narrow ridge of her grandmother’s body until she came to her shoulders. There her fingers tangled in the long wisps of Granny’s hair. She pressed a finger against the side of Granny’s throat to feel for her pulse, as the doctor had shown her. It was fluttery, like a moth that has hurt itself and is flapping in crooked circles. “Can I get you some water, Granny?” Lina asked. She couldn’t think what else to do. “No water,” Granny said. “Just stay for a while.” Lina tucked one foot underneath her and pulled part of the blanket over her lap. She took hold of Granny’s hand again and stroked it gently with one finger. For a long time neither of them said anything. Lina sat listening to her grandmother’s breathing. She would take a deep, shuddering breath and let it out in a sigh. Then there would be a long silence before the next breath began. Lina closed her eyes. No use keeping them open—there was nothing to see but the dark. She was aware only of her grandmother’s cold, thin hand and the sound of her breathing. Every now and then Granny would mumble a few words Lina couldn’t make out, and then Lina would stroke her forehead and say, “Don’t worry, it’s all right. It’s almost morning,” though she didn’t know if it was or not. After a long time, Granny stirred slightly and seemed to come awake. “You go to bed, dear,” she said. “I’m all right now.” Her voice was clear but very faint. “You go back to sleep.” Lina bent forward until her head rested against Granny’s shoulder. Granny’s soft hair tickled her face. “All right, then,” she whispered. “Good night, Granny.” She squeezed her grandmother’s shoulders gently, and as she stood up a wave of terrible loneliness swept over her. She wanted to see Granny’s face. But the darkness hid everything. It might still be a long time until morning—she didn’t know. She groped her way back to her own bed and fell into a deep sleep, and when, hours later, the clock tower struck six and the lights came on, Lina went fearfully into her grandmother’s room. She found her very pale and very still, all the life gone out of her."
City of Ember Chapter 11,"Lina spent all that day in Mrs. Murdo’s house, which was just like theirs, only neater. There was one couch, and one fat chair covered in fuzzy striped material, and one big table, only Mrs. Murdo’s table wasn’t wobbly like theirs. On the table was a basket, and in the basket were three turnips, each of them lavender on one end and white on the other. Mrs. Murdo must have put them there, Lina thought, not just because she was going to have them for dinner, but also because they were beautiful. Lina sat sideways on the couch with her legs stretched out, and Mrs. Murdo covered her with a soft gray-green blanket. “This will keep you warm,” she said, tucking it around Lina’s legs. Lina didn’t really feel cold but she did feel sad, which was in a way the same. The blanket felt good, like someone holding her. Mrs. Murdo gave Poppy a long purple scarf to play with and made a creamy mushroom soup with potatoes, and all day Lina stayed there, snuggled under the blanket. She thought about her grandmother, who had had a long and mostly cheerful life. She cried some and fell asleep. She woke up and played with Poppy. The day had a strange but comforting feel to it, like a rest between the end of one time and the beginning of another. On the morning of the next day, Lina got up and got ready to go to work. Mrs. Murdo gave her beet tea and spinach hash for breakfast. “The Singing’s coming up soon,” she remarked to Lina as they ate. “Do you know your part?” “Yes,” said Lina. “I remember it pretty well from last year.” “I rather like the Singing,” said Mrs. Murdo. “I love it,” Lina said. “I think it’s my favorite day of the year.” Once a year, the people of the city came together to sing the three great songs of Ember. Just thinking of it made Lina feel better. She finished her breakfast and put on her red jacket. “Don’t worry about Poppy, I’ll take care of her,” said Mrs. Murdo as Lina headed for the door. “When you come back this evening, we’ll talk about how to proceed.” “Proceed?” said Lina. “Well, you can’t live by yourselves, just the two of you, can you?” “We can’t?” “Certainly not,” said Mrs. Murdo sternly. “Who’s to take care of Poppy while you go off delivering messages? You must move in here with me. I have an empty bedroom, after all, and quite a nice one. Come and look.” She opened a door at the far end of the living room, and Lina peeked in. She had never seen such a beautiful, cozy room. There was a big, lumpy bed covered with a faded blue blanket, and at its head four plump pillows. Next to the bed was a chest of drawers with drawer handles shaped like teardrops and a mirror attached to the top. The carpets on the floor were all different shades of blue and green, and in the corner was a sturdy square table and a chair with a back like a ladder. “This will be your room,” said Mrs. Murdo. “Yours and Poppy’s. You’ll have to share the bed, but it’s big enough.” “It’s lovely,” Lina said. “You’re so kind, Mrs. Murdo.” “Well,” said Mrs. Murdo briskly, “it’s just common sense. You need a place. I have one. You go on now, and I’ll see you this evening.” — Three days had passed since Lina and Doon had seen the man in the Pipeworks, and there hadn’t been any special announcements. So if that man had discovered a way out of Ember, he was keeping the news to himself. Lina couldn’t understand why. As Lina ran through the city with her messages on her first day back to work, it seemed to her that the mood of the people was even gloomier than before. There were long, silent lines at the markets, and knots of people gathered in the squares, talking in low voices. Many shops—more each day, it seemed—displayed signs in their windows saying “Closed” or “Open Mon. Tues. only.” Every now and then, the lights flickered, and people stopped and looked up in fright. When the flickering ended and the lights stayed lit, people just took a breath and walked on. Lina delivered her messages as usual, but inside she felt strange. Everywhere she ran, she heard the same words, like a drumbeat, in her mind: alone in the world, alone in the world. It wasn’t exactly true. She had Poppy. She had friends. And she had Mrs. Murdo, who was somewhere between a friend and a relative. But she felt as if she had suddenly gotten older in the last three days. She was a sort of mother herself now. What happened to Poppy was more or less up to her. As the day went on, she stopped thinking alone in the world and began thinking about her new life at Mrs. Murdo’s. She thought about the blue-green room and planned how she would arrange her pictures on the walls. The one she’d drawn with her blue pencil would look especially nice, because it would match the color of the rugs. She could bring her pillows from home and add them to the ones on the bed, and then she’d have six altogether—and maybe she could find some old blue dresses or shirts and make pillow covers for them. The blue-green room, the orderly apartment, the meals cooked, and the blankets tucked in cozily at night—all this gave her a feeling of comfort, almost luxury. She was grateful for Mrs. Murdo’s kindness. I am not ready yet to be alone in the world, she thought. Late that afternoon, Lina was given a message to take to Lampling Street. She delivered the message and, as she was coming back out onto the street, caught sight of Lizzie coming out the door of the Supply Depot—her orange hair was unmistakable. “Lizzie!” Lina called out. Lizzie must not have heard her. She kept on going. Lina called again. “Lizzie, wait!” This time it was clear that Lizzie had heard, but instead of stopping, she walked faster. What’s the matter with her? Lina wondered. She ran after her and grabbed the back of her coat. “Lizzie, it’s me!” Lizzie stopped and turned around. “Oh!” she said. Her face was flushed. “It’s you. Hi! I thought it was…I didn’t realize it was you.” She smiled brightly, but there was a distracted look in her eyes. “I was just going home,” she said. Her arms were wrapped around a small bulging sack. “I’ll walk with you,” said Lina. “Oh,” said Lizzie. “Oh, good.” But she didn’t look pleased. “Lizzie, something sad has happened,” Lina said. “My grandmother died.” Lizzie gave her a quick sideways glance, but she didn’t stop walking. “That’s too bad,” she said absently. “Poor you.” What was wrong with her? Lizzie was ordinarily so interested in other people’s misfortunes. She could be sincerely sympathetic, too, when she wasn’t wrapped up in her own troubles. Lina changed the subject. “What’s in the sack?” she asked. “Oh, just some groceries,” said Lizzie. “I stopped at the market after work.” “You did?” Lina was confused. She had seen Lizzie not two minutes ago leaving the storeroom office. Lizzie didn’t answer. She began walking and talking quite fast. “It was so busy today at work. Work is so hard, isn’t it, Lina? I think work is much harder than school, and not as interesting. You do the same thing every day. I get so tired, don’t you, running around all day?” Lina started to say that she liked running and hardly ever got tired, but Lizzie didn’t wait for her to answer. “Oh, well, at least there are some good things about it. Guess what, Lina? I have a boyfriend. I met him at work. He really likes me—he says my hair is the exact color of a red-hot burner on a stove.” Lina laughed. “It’s true, Lizzie,” she said. “You look like your head is on fire.” Lizzie laughed, too, and lifted one hand to fluff her hair. She puckered her lips and fluttered her eyelashes. “He says I’m as beautiful as a red tomato.” They were crossing Torrick Square now. It was crowded in the square. People had just left work and were lining up at the shops and hurrying along with packages. A cluster of children sat on the pavement, playing some sort of game. “Who is this boyfriend?” asked Lina. But just at that moment, Lizzie tripped. She’d been strutting along being beautiful, not paying attention to her feet, and the edge of her shoe caught on an uneven place in the pavement. She staggered and fell, and as she fell she lost her grip on the sack. It hit the ground and toppled sideways, and some cans spilled out. They rolled in all different directions. Lina reached for Lizzie’s arm. “Did you hurt yourself?” she asked, but Lizzie went scrambling after the cans so quickly it was clear she wasn’t hurt. Wanting to help, Lina went after the cans, too. Two had rolled under a bench. Another was going toward the children, who were on their feet now, watching Lizzie’s wild spider-like motions. Lina picked up the cans under the bench, and for a second her breath stopped. One of them was a can of peaches. “Peaches,” it said right on it, and there was a picture of a yellow globe. No one she knew had seen a can of peaches in years. She looked at the other one. It was just as amazing—“Creamed Corn,” it said. Lina remembered having creamed corn once, as a thrilling treat, when she was five years old. There was a shout. She looked up. One of the children had picked up a can. “Look at this!” he cried, and the other children gathered around him. “Applesauce!” he said, and the children murmured, “Applesauce, applesauce,” as if they had never heard the word before. Lizzie was on her feet. She had all the cans except for the two in Lina’s hands and the one the child had picked up. She stood there for a moment, her eyes flicking back and forth from Lina to the children. Then she smiled, a bright fake-looking smile. “Thanks for helping me,” she said. “I found these on a back shelf at the market. What a surprise, huh? You can keep those.” She waved the back of her hand at the children, waved again at Lina, and then took off, holding the sack by its neck so it hung beside her and banged against her legs. Lina didn’t follow her. She walked home, thinking about Lizzie’s sack of cans. You simply did not find cans of peaches and applesauce and creamed corn on the back shelves of markets. Lizzie was lying. And if the cans hadn’t come from a market, where had they come from? There was only one answer: they had come from the storerooms. Somehow, Lizzie had gotten them because she worked in the storeroom office. Had she paid for them? How much? Or had she taken them without paying? Mrs. Murdo had cooked a dinner of beet-and-bean stew for them that night. When Lina showed her the two cans, she gasped in astonishment. “Where did you get these?” she asked. “From a friend,” said Lina. “And where did your friend get them?” Lina shrugged. “I don’t know.” Mrs. Murdo frowned slightly but didn’t ask any more questions. She opened the cans, and they had a feast: creamed corn with their stew, and peaches for dessert. It was the best meal Lina had had in a very long time—but her enjoyment of it was tainted just a little by the question of where it had come from. — The next morning, Lina headed for Broad Street. Before she started delivering messages today, she was going to have a talk with Lizzie. She spied her half a block from the storeroom office. She was sauntering along looking in shop windows. A long green scarf was wound around her neck. Lina ran up swiftly behind her. “Lizzie,” she said. Lizzie whirled around. When she saw Lina, she flinched. She didn’t say anything, just turned around and kept walking. Lina caught hold of one end of the green scarf and jerked Lizzie to a halt. “Lizzie!” she said. “Stop!” “What for?” Lizzie said. “I’m going to work.” She tried to pull away, but she didn’t get far, because Lina had a firm grip on her scarf. Lina spoke in a low voice. There were people all around them—a couple of old men leaning against the wall, a group of chattering children just ahead, workers going toward the storerooms—and she didn’t want to be overheard. “You have to tell me where you got those cans,” she said. “I told you. I found them on a back shelf at the market. Let go of my scarf.” Lizzie tried to wrench her scarf out of Lina’s grip, but Lina held on. “You didn’t,” Lina said. “No market would just forget about things like that. Tell me the truth.” She gave a yank on the end of the scarf. “Stop it!” Lizzie reached out and grabbed a handful of Lina’s hair. Lina yelped and pulled harder on the scarf, and the two of them scuffled, snatching at each other’s hair and coats. They knocked against a woman who snapped at them angrily, and finally they toppled over, sitting down hard on the pavement. Lina was the first one to laugh. It was so much like what they used to do in fun, chasing each other and screaming with laughter. Now here they were again, nearly grown girls, sitting in a heap on the pavement. After a moment, Lizzie laughed, too. “You dope,” she said. “All right, I’ll tell you. I sort of wanted to anyway.” Lizzie leaned forward with her elbows on her knees and lowered her voice. “Well, it’s this,” she said. “There’s a storeroom worker named Looper. He’s a carrier. Do you know him? He was two classes ahead of us. Looper Windly.” “I know who he is,” said Lina. “I took a message for him on my first day of work. Tall, with a long skinny neck. Big teeth. Funny-looking.” Lizzie looked hurt. “Well, I wouldn’t describe him that way. I think he’s handsome.” Lina shrugged. “Okay. Go on.” “Looper explores the storerooms. He goes into every room that isn’t locked. He wants to know the true situation, Lina. He’s not like most workers, who just plod along doing their jobs and then go home. He wants to find things out.” “And what has he found out?” Lina asked. “He’s found out that there’s still a little bit left of some rare things, just a few things in rooms here and there that have been forgotten. You know, Lina,” she said, “there are so many rooms down there. Some of them, way out at the edges, are marked ‘Empty’ in the ledger book, and so no one ever goes there anymore. But Looper found out that they’re not all empty.” “So he’s been taking things.” “Just a few things! And not often.” “And he’s giving some to you.” “Yes. Because he likes me.” Lizzie smiled a little smile and hugged her arms together. I see, Lina thought. She feels that way about Looper. “But Looper’s stealing,” said Lina. “And Lizzie—he isn’t just stealing things for you. He has a store! He steals things and sells them for huge prices!” “He does not,” said Lizzie, but she looked worried. “He does. I know because I bought something from him just a few weeks ago. He has a whole box of colored pencils.” Lizzie scowled. “He never gave me any colored pencils.” “He shouldn’t be giving you anything—or selling things. Don’t you think everyone should know about this food he found?” “No!” Lizzie cried. “Because listen. If there’s only one can of peaches left, only one person gets to have it, right? So why should everyone know? They’d just end up fighting over it. What good would that be?” Lizzie reached out and put a hand on Lina’s knee. “Listen,” she said. “I’ll ask Looper to find some good stuff for you, too. I know he will, if I ask him.” Before she had time to think, Lina heard herself saying, “What kind of good stuff?” Lizzie’s eyes gleamed. “There’s two packages of colored paper, he told me. And some cough medicine. And there’s three pairs of girls’ shoes.” It was treasure. Colored paper! And cough medicine to cure sickness, and shoes…she hadn’t had new ones for almost two years. Lina’s heart raced. What Lizzie said was true: if everyone knew there were still a few wonderful things in the storerooms, people would fight each other trying to get them. But what if no one knew? What difference would it make if she had the colored paper, or the shoes? She suddenly wanted those things so badly she felt weak. A picture arose in her mind’s eye—the shelves at Mrs. Murdo’s house stocked with good things, and the three of them happier and safer than other people. Lizzie leaned closer and lowered her voice. “Looper found a can of pineapple. I was going to split it with him, but I’ll give you a bite if you promise not to tell.” Pineapple! That delectable long-lost thing that her grandmother had told her about. Was there anything wrong with having a bite of it, just to see what it was like? “I’ve already tasted peaches, applesauce, and a thing called fruit cocktail,” said Lizzie. “And prunes and creamed corn and cranberry sauce and asparagus…” “All that?” Lina was astonished. “Then there’s a lot of special things like that still?” “No,” said Lizzie. “Not a lot at all. In fact, we’ve finished all those.” “You and Looper?” Lizzie nodded, smiling smugly. “Looper says it’s all going to be gone soon anyway, why not live as well as we can right now?” “But Lizzie, why should you get all that? Why you and not other people?” “Because we found it. Because we can get at it.” “I don’t think it’s fair,” said Lina. Lizzie spoke as if she were talking to a not-very-bright child. “You can have some, too. That’s what I’m telling you. There are still a few good things left.” But that wasn’t the unfairness Lina was thinking of. It was that just two people were getting things that everyone would have wanted. She couldn’t think how it should have been done. You couldn’t divide a can of applesauce evenly among all the people in the city. Still, something was wrong with grabbing the good things just because you could. It seemed not only unfair to everyone else but bad for the person who was doing it, somehow. She remembered the hunger she’d felt when Looper showed her the colored pencils. It wasn’t a pleasant feeling. She didn’t want to want things that way. She stood up. “I don’t want anything from Looper.” Lizzie shrugged. “Okay,” she said, but there was a look of dismay on her small pale face. “Too bad for you.” “Thanks anyway,” said Lina, and she set off across Torrick Square, walking fast at first and then breaking into a run."
City of Ember Chapter 12,"About a week after he and Lina had seen the man come out the mysterious door, Doon was assigned to fix a clog in Tunnel 207. It turned out to be easy. He undid the pipe, rammed a long thin brush down it, and a jet of water spurted into his face. Once he’d put the pipe back together, he had nothing else to do. So he decided to go out to Tunnel 351 and take another look at the locked door. It was strange, he thought, that no announcement about a way out of Ember had come. Maybe that door had not been what they thought it was. So he set out for the south end of the Pipeworks. When he came to the roped-off passage in Tunnel 351, he ducked in and walked along through the dark, feeling his way. He was pretty sure the door would be locked as usual. His mind was on other things. He was thinking of his green worm, which had been behaving oddly, refusing to eat and hanging from the side of its box with its chin tucked in. And he was thinking about Lina, whom he hadn’t seen for several days. He wondered where she was. When he came to the door, he reached absently for the knob, and what he felt startled him so much that he snatched his hand back as if he’d been stung. He felt again, carefully. There was a key in the lock! For a long moment, Doon stood as still as a statue. Then he took hold of the doorknob and turned it. Very slowly, he pushed on the door. It swung inward without a sound. He opened it only a few inches, just enough to peer around the edge. What he saw made him gasp. There was no road, or passage, or stairway behind the door. There was a brightly lit room, whose size he could not guess at because it was so crowded with things. On all sides were crates and boxes, sacks and bundles and packages. There were mounds of cans, heaps of clothes, rows of jars and bottles, stacks of light-bulb packages. Piles rose to the low ceiling and leaned against the walls, blocking all but a small space in the center. In that small space, a little living room had been set up. There was a greenish rug, and on the rug an armchair and a table. On the table were dishes smeared with the remains of food, and in the armchair facing Doon was a great blob of a person whose head was flopped backward, so that all Doon could see of it was an upthrust chin. The blob stirred and muttered, and Doon, in the second before he stepped back and pulled the door closed, caught a glimpse of a fleshy ear, a slab of gray cheek, and a loose, purplish mouth. — That day, Lina had more messages to carry than ever. There had been five blackouts in a row during the week. They were all fairly short—the longest was four and a half minutes, Lina had heard—but there had never been so many so close together. Everyone was nervous. People who might ordinarily walk to someone’s house were sending messages instead. Often they didn’t even come out into the street but beckoned to a messenger from their doorway. By five o’clock, Lina had carried thirty-nine messages. Most of them were more or less the same: “I’m not coming to the meeting tonight, decided to stay home.” “I won’t be in to work tomorrow.” “Instead of meeting me in Cloving Square, why don’t you come to my house?” The citizens of Ember were hunkering down, burrowing in. Fewer people stood around talking in groups under the lights in the squares. Instead, they would pause briefly to murmur a few words to each other and then hasten onward. Lina was on her way home to Mrs. Murdo’s—she and Poppy had moved in with all their things—when she heard rapid footsteps. Startled, she turned and saw Doon racing toward her. At first he was so out of breath he couldn’t speak. “What is it? What is it?” said Lina. “The door,” he panted. “The door in 351. I opened it.” Lina’s heart leapt. “You did?” Doon nodded. “Is it the way out?” Lina whispered fiercely. “No,” Doon said. He glanced behind him. Clutching Lina’s arm, he pulled her into a shadowy spot on the street. “It doesn’t lead out of Ember,” he whispered. “It leads to a big room.” Lina’s face fell. “A room? What’s in there?” “Everything. Food, clothes, boxes, cans. Light bulbs, stacks of them. Everything. Piles and piles up to the ceiling.” His eyes grew wide. “And someone was there, in the middle of it all, asleep.” “Who?” A look of horror passed over Doon’s face. “The mayor,” he said. “Conked out in a big armchair, with an empty plate in front of him.” “The mayor!” Lina whispered. “Yes. The mayor has a secret treasure room in the Pipeworks.” They stared at each other, speechless. Then Doon suddenly stamped hard on the pavement. His face flushed red. “That’s the solution he keeps telling us about. It’s a solution for him, not the rest of us. He gets everything he needs, and we get the leftovers! He doesn’t care about the city. All he cares about is his fat stomach!” Lina felt dizzy, as if she’d been hit on the head. “What will we do?” She couldn’t think, she was so stunned. “Tell everyone!” said Doon. He was shaking with anger. “Tell the whole city the mayor is robbing us!” “Wait, wait.” Lina put a hand on Doon’s arm and concentrated for a minute. “Come on,” she said at last. “Let’s go sit in Harken Square. I have something to tell you, too.” — At the north end of Harken Square stood a circle of Believers, clapping their hands and singing one of their songs. Lately they seemed to be singing more loudly and cheerfully than ever. Their voices were shrill. “Coming soon to save us!” they wailed. “Happy, happy day!” Near the Gathering Hall steps, something unusual was happening. Twenty or so people were pacing around and around, carrying big signs painted on old planks and on big banners made of sheets. The signs said “WHAT solutions, Mayor Cole?” and “We want ANSWERS!” Every now and then the demonstrators would yell these slogans out loud. Lina wondered if the mayor was paying any attention. Doon and Lina found an empty bench on the south side of Harken Square and sat down. “Now, listen,” said Lina. “I am listening,” said Doon, though his face was still red and the look on his face was stormy. “I saw Lizzie coming out of the storerooms yesterday,” Lina said. She told him about the cans, and Lizzie’s new friend, Looper, and what Looper was doing. Doon pounded his fist on his leg. “That’s two of them doing it, then,” he said. “Wait, there’s more. Remember how I thought there was something familiar about the man who came out the door? I’ve remembered what. It was that way he walked, sort of dipping over sideways, and also that hair, that black hair all unbrushed and sticking out. I’ve seen him twice. I don’t know why I didn’t remember who it was right away—maybe because I’ve only seen him from the front. I took a message for him on my first day.” Doon was jiggling with impatience. “Well, who was it, who was it?” “It was Looper. Looper, who works in the storerooms. Lizzie’s boyfriend. And Doon—” Lina leaned forward. “It was a message to the mayor that he gave me, and it was this: ‘Delivery at eight.’ ” Doon’s mouth dropped open. “So that means…” “He’s taking things from the storeroom for the mayor. And he’s giving some to Lizzie, and selling some in his store.” “Oh!” cried Doon. He slapped his hand against his head. “Why didn’t I get it before? There’s a hatch in the ceiling near Tunnel 351. It must go right up into the storerooms. Looper comes through there! That’s what we heard that day, remember? A sort of scraping—that would have been the hatch opening. Then a thud—his sack of stuff dropping through—and then a sound like someone jumping down and landing hard on the ground.” “And then walking slowly—” “Because he was carrying a load!” “And walking quickly on the way out because he’d left it all for the mayor.” Lina took a deep breath. Her heart was drumming and her hands were cold. “We have to think what to do,” she said. “If this were an ordinary situation, the mayor would be the one to tell.” “But the mayor is the one committing the crime,” said Doon. “So then we should tell the guards, I guess,” said Lina. “They’re next in authority to the mayor. Though I don’t like them much,” she added, remembering how she’d been so roughly hustled down the stairs from the roof of the Gathering Hall. “Especially the chief guard.” “But you’re right,” Doon said. “We should tell the guards. They’ll go down into the Pipeworks and see for themselves that we’re telling the truth. Then they can arrest the mayor and have all the stuff put back in the storerooms, and then they can tell the city what’s been going on.” “That’s a much better idea,” said Lina. “Then you and I can get back to what’s more important.” “What?” “Figuring out the Instructions. Now that we know that the door we found wasn’t the right one, we have to find the right one.” “I don’t know,” said Doon. “We might be all wrong about those Instructions. They could just be about some old Pipeworks tool closet.” He made a sour face. “ ‘Instructions for Egreston.’ Who’s Egreston? Or Egresman? Or whoever it was? Why couldn’t he have been just an especially stupid Pipeworks guy who needed instructions to find his way around?” He shook his head. “I don’t know. I think maybe those Instructions are just hogwash.” “Hogwash? What’s that?” “It means nonsense. I read it in a book in the library.” “But they can’t be nonsense! Why would they have been kept in a box like that? With the strange lock?” But Doon didn’t want to think about the Instructions right then. “We’ll figure it out tomorrow,” he said. “Right now, let’s go find the guards.” “Wait,” said Lina, catching hold of the sleeve of his jacket. “I have one more thing to tell you.” “What?” “My grandmother died.” “Oh!” Doon’s face fell. “That’s so sad,” he said. “I’m sorry.” His sympathy made tears spring to Lina’s eyes. Doon looked startled for a moment, and then he took a step toward her and wrapped his arms around her. He gave her a squeeze so quick and tight that it made her cough, and then it made her laugh. She realized all at once that Doon—thin, dark-eyed Doon with his troublesome temper and his terrible brown jacket and his good heart—was the person that she knew better than anyone now. He was her best friend. “Thanks,” she said. “Well.” She smiled at him. “Let’s go and talk to the guard.” They crossed the square and climbed the steps of the Gathering Hall. Sitting at the big reception desk outside the door of the mayor’s office was the assistant guard, Barton Snode, the same one Lina had encountered her first time here. Snode looked bored. His elbows were on the desk, and his chin was moving very slowly from side to side. “Sir,” said Doon, “we need to speak with you.” The guard looked up. “Certainly,” he said. “Go right ahead.” “In private,” said Lina. The guard looked puzzled. His small eyes darted back and forth. “This is private,” he said. “No one here but me.” “But anyone could come along,” said Doon. “What we have to say is secret, and very important.” “Very important?” said Snode. “Secret?” His face brightened. Grunting, he raised himself up from his chair and motioned them into a narrow hallway off to the side of the main hall. “What is it?” he said. They told him. As they spoke, interrupting each other to make sure they got in all the details, the guard’s eyebrows gradually lifted higher and higher over his eyes. “You saw this room?” he said. “This is true? Are you sure?” He was chewing faster now. “You mean the mayor…you mean the mayor is…” At that moment, a little way down the hall, a door opened. Through it came three more guards, including—Lina spotted him by his beard—the chief guard. They strode forward, talking to each other in low voices, and as they passed, the chief guard threw a quick glance at Lina. Does he recognize me? Lina wondered. She couldn’t tell. Barton Snode finished his sentence in a husky whisper. “You mean…the mayor is stealing?” “That’s right,” said Doon. “We thought you should be informed, because who else can arrest the mayor? And once you’ve done that, the guards can put all the things he’s stolen back where they came from.” “And then tell the city that a new mayor has to be found,” added Lina. Barton Snode leaned heavily against the wall and rubbed a hand over his chin. He seemed to be thinking. “Something must be done,” he said. “This is shocking, shocking.” He started back toward his desk, and Doon and Lina followed. “I will make a note,” he said, taking a pencil from the desk drawer. Lina watched as he wrote slowly on a scrap of paper: “Mayor stealing. Secret room.” When he’d finished, he let out a satisfied breath. “Very good,” he said. “Action will be taken, you may be sure. Some sort of action. Quite soon.” “Good,” said Doon. “Thank you,” said Lina, and they turned to leave. The three guards were standing by the main door of the Gathering Hall as Doon and Lina went out. The chief guard moved aside to make way for them, and they went through the door and out onto the wide front steps. Lina glanced over her shoulder. Before the door swung closed, she saw the chief guard striding toward the reception desk, where Barton Snode was standing up, leaning forward, his eyes shining with important news."
City of Ember Chapter 13,"Doon headed for home, and Lina went in the opposite direction across Harken Square. The little group of Believers had gone, but the protesters with their signs continued to pace back and forth. A few of them were still shaking their fists in the air and yelling, but most of them tramped silently, looking tired and discouraged. Lina felt a bit that way, too. Once Doon said he’d seen a door, she was sure that the door he’d found and the door in the Instructions were the same. She had had such hopes for that door in the Pipeworks. But hoping so hard had made her jump to conclusions. She’d gone a little too fast. She always went fast. Sometimes it was a good thing and sometimes not. Now Doon thought the Instructions were nothing important after all. She didn’t want him to be right. She didn’t believe he was, even now. But her thoughts felt like a mess of tangled yarn. She needed someone wise and sensible to help her sort things out. She headed for Glome Street. — Though it was nearly six o’clock, she found Clary still in her workroom, at the far end of Greenhouse 1. It was a small, crowded room. Pots and trowels cluttered a high table at one end. Above the table were shelves full of bottles of seeds, and boxes of string, wire, and various kinds of powders. Clary’s desk was a rickety table, littered with scraps of paper, all of them covered with notes in her neat, round handwriting. Two rickety chairs went with the rickety table, one on each side. Lina sat down facing Clary. “I have to tell you some important things,” she said. “And they’re all secret.” “All right,” said Clary. “I can keep secrets.” She was wearing a patched shirt that had faded from blue to gray. Her short brown hair was tucked behind her ears, and a bit of leaf clung to it on the right-hand side. She folded her arms in front of her on the desk. She looked square and solid. “The first thing is,” Lina began, “that I found the Instructions. But Poppy had chewed them up.” “The Instructions,” said Clary. “I’m not familiar with them.” Lina explained. She went on to explain everything—how she’d shown the Instructions to Doon, what they had figured out, how he’d searched the Pipeworks and found the door, and what he’d seen when he opened the door. Clary made an unhappy sound and shook her head. “This is very bad,” she said. “And sad, too. I remember when the mayor was first starting out. He has always been foolish, but not always wicked. I’m sorry to know that the worst side of him has won out.” Clary’s dark brown eyes seemed to grow deeper and sadder. “There is so much darkness in Ember, Lina. It’s not just outside, it’s inside us, too. Everyone has some darkness inside. It’s like a hungry creature. It wants and wants and wants with a terrible power. And the more you give it, the bigger and hungrier it gets.” Lina knew. She had felt it in Looper’s shop as she hovered over the colored pencils. For a moment, she felt sorry for the mayor. His hunger had grown so big it could never be satisfied. His huge body couldn’t contain it. It made him forget everything else. Clary let out a long breath, and a few of the scraps of paper on her desk fluttered. She ran her fingers through her hair, felt the bit of leaf, and plucked it out. Then she said, “About these Instructions.” “Oh, yes,” said Lina. “They might be important, or they might not be. I don’t know anymore.” “I’d like to see them, if you’d let me.” “Of course you can see them—but you’ll have to come home with me.” “I’ll come now, if that’s all right,” said Clary. “There’s plenty of time before lights out.” — Lina led Clary up the stairs and into her new bedroom at Mrs. Murdo’s. “Nice room,” Clary said, looking around with interest. “And I see you have a sprout.” “A what?” said Lina. “Your bean,” said Clary, pointing at the little pot of dirt on the windowsill. Lina bent to see what Clary was talking about. Sure enough, the dirt was heaving up a little. She touched the pushed-up part, brushed away the dirt, and discovered a pale green loop. It looked like a neck, as if a creature in the bean were trying to escape but hadn’t yet managed to pull its head out. Of course she already knew that plants grew from seeds. But to have put that flat white bean in the dirt, to have almost forgotten about it, and now to see it forcing its way up into the air… “It’s doing it!” she said. “It’s coming to life!” Clary nodded, smiling. “Still amazes me every time I see it,” she said. Lina brought out the Instructions, and Clary sat down at the table to study them. She puzzled over the patchwork of scraps for a long time, tracing the lines with her finger, murmuring the parts of words. “What you’ve figured out so far seems right to me,” she said. “I think ‘ip ork’ must be ‘Pipeworks.’ And ‘iverb nk’ must be ‘riverbank.’ So this bit must be ‘down riverbank’— then there’s a big space here—‘to edge.’ Edge of what, I wonder? And does it mean ‘down riverbank’ as in ‘walk alongside the river’?” “Yes, I think so,” Lina said. “Or does it mean go down the riverbank itself, down the bank toward the water? Maybe ‘edge’ means ‘edge of the water.’ ” “It couldn’t mean that. The bank goes straight down like a wall. You couldn’t go down to the edge of the water, you’d fall in.” Lina pictured the dark, swift water and shivered. “This word,” said Clary, putting a finger on the paper. “Maybe it isn’t ‘edge,’ maybe it’s something else. It could be ‘hedge.’ Or ‘pledge.’ Those don’t make much sense. But it could be ‘ledge’ or ‘wedge.’ ” Lina saw that Clary was no better at deciphering the puzzle than she was. She sighed and sat down on the end of her bed. “It’s hopeless,” she said. Clary straightened up quickly. “Don’t say that. This torn-up piece of paper is the most hopeful thing I’ve ever seen. Do you know what this word is?” She pointed to the word at the top of the paper, Egres. “Someone’s name, isn’t it? The title would be ‘Instructions for Egreston,’ or maybe ‘Egresman,’ or something like that. The person the instructions were for.” “I don’t think so,” said Clary. “If you add an s to this word, right where this tear in the paper is, you get ‘Egress.’ Do you know what that means?” “No,” said Lina. “It means ‘the way out.’ It means ‘the exit.’ The title of this document is ‘Instructions for Egress.’ ” — When Clary left, there was still over an hour before lights out. Lina raced across the city to Greengate Square. She glanced in the window of the Small Items shop, where Doon’s father was reaching for something on a shelf, and then she dashed up the stairs and knocked on the door of Doon’s apartment. Right away, she heard quick steps and Doon opened the door. “I have something exciting to tell you,” Lina said breathlessly. “Come in, then.” Lina went across the cluttered room to stand by a lamp. She pulled from her pocket a tiny piece of paper on which she had written “Egres.” “Look at this word,” she said. “It’s from the title of the Instructions. Someone’s name,” said Doon. “No,” said Lina. “It’s meant to be ‘Egress,’ with two s’s. I showed the Instructions to Clary, and she told me. It means ‘the way out.’ ” “The way out!” cried Doon. “Yes! The way out. The exit. It’s instructions for the way out of Ember!” “So it is real,” Doon said. “It is. We have to figure out the rest. Or as much of the rest as possible. Can you come now?” He darted into his room, emerged with his jacket, and they ran. — “All right,” said Lina. They were on the floor of the blue-green room at Mrs. Murdo’s. “Let’s take the first line.” She moved her finger along it slowly. “We know that ‘ip ork’ is Pipeworks,” she said. “ ‘Exp’ could be ‘expand,’ or ‘explore,’ or ‘expose’ …” “There’s a big space between ‘Exp’ and the rest,” said Doon. “There must be more words in there.” “But who knows what they are? Let’s move on.” Lina swept her straggly hair impatiently back from her face. “Look at number two.” Lina put her finger on ston. “What could that be?” “Maybe ‘piston,’ ” said Doon. “That’s part of a machine, like the generator. Or maybe it’s ‘astonish.’ Or it could be…” “I bet it’s just plain ‘stone,’ ” said Lina. “There’s a lot of stone in the Pipeworks.” Doon had to admit this was probably right. “So then,” he said, “it would be ‘stone marked with E.…’ ” He frowned at the next bit. “This must be ‘river’s edge.’ ‘Stone marked with E by the river’s edge.’ ” They looked at each other in delight. “E for Egress!” cried Lina. “E for Exit!” They bent over the document again. “There’s not much left of this next line,” said Doon. “Just this part—which must say, ‘down riverbank to edge’…something.” “ ‘Edge of water’ would make sense. But right after ‘edge’ there’s ‘app.’ What would that be?” Doon sat back on his heels and gazed up at the ceiling, as if the answer might be there. Lina muttered, “down riverbank to edge, edge.” She thought of Clary’s guesses about that line. “Maybe it’s ‘ledge,’ ” she said. “ ‘Down riverbank to ledge.’ There could be a ledge down near the water.” “Yes, that must be right. There’s a stone marked with E, and down the riverbank at that point there’s a ledge. I think we’re getting it.” Once again they crouched over the page, their heads close together. “Okay,” Doon said. “Line 4.” “This is where it says ‘door,’ ” Lina said. “Somehow the door is by the ledge. Does that make sense?” “And there’s that ‘small steel pan’—what can that mean? What would a pan have to do with anything?” “But look, but look.” Lina tapped the paper urgently. “Here it says ‘ke’ and here it says ‘ey.’ It’s talking about a key!” “But what is it a door to?” said Doon, sitting back. “Remember, we thought about this before. A door in the bank of the river would lead under the Pipeworks.” Lina pondered this. “Maybe it leads to a long tunnel that goes way out beyond Ember, and then gradually up and up until it comes out at the other city.” “What other city?” Doon glanced up at the drawings tacked to the walls of Lina’s room. “Oh,” he said. “You mean that city.” “Well, it could be.” Doon shrugged. “I suppose so. Or it could be another city exactly like this one.” That was a gloomy thought. Both of them felt their spirits sink a little at the idea. So they turned back to the task of deciphering. “Next line,” said Lina. But Doon sat back on his heels again. He stared into the air, half smiling. “I have an idea,” he said. “If we do find the way out, we’ll need to announce it to everyone. Wouldn’t it be splendid to do it during the Singing? Stand up there in front of the whole city and say we’ve found it?” “It would be,” Lina said. “But that’s only two days away.” “Yes. We have to hurry.” They were bending again over the glued-down fragments when Doon remembered that he should check the time. It was a quarter to nine. He barely had time to get home. “Come again tomorrow,” said Lina. “And while you’re at work, look for the rock marked with E.” — That night, Doon had trouble sleeping. He couldn’t find a comfortable position on his bed. It seemed to be made up of nothing but lumps and wrinkles, and it squeaked and groaned every time he moved. He flailed around so much that the noise woke his father, who came to his room and asked, “What is it, son? Nightmares?” “No,” said Doon. “Just can’t sleep.” “Are you worrying? Frightened of anything?” Doon wanted to say, Yes, Father. I’m worried because the mayor of our city is taking for himself the things that people need, and I’m afraid because any day our lights could go out forever. I’m worried and afraid a lot of the time, but I’m also excited because I think there is a way out, and we might find it—and all those feelings are whirling around in my head, which makes it hard to sleep. He could have told his father everything. His father would have plunged in with great enthusiasm. He would have helped them decipher the Instructions and expose the mayor’s thievery; he would even have come down into the Pipeworks and helped search for the rock marked with E. But Doon wanted to keep these things to himself for now. Tomorrow, the guards would announce that an alert young boy had uncovered the mayor’s crime, and his father, hearing the announcements along with the rest of Ember, would turn to the person next to him and say, “That’s my son they’re talking about! My son!” So in answer to his father’s question, he simply said, “No, Father, I’m all right.” “Well, then, see if you can’t lie still,” said his father. “Good night, son,” he added, and closed the door. Doon smoothed out his covers and pulled them up to his chin. He closed his eyes. But still he couldn’t sleep. So he tried a method that had often worked for him before. He would choose a place he knew well—the school, for instance—and imagine himself walking through it, picturing it as he went in minute detail. Often his thoughts would wander, but he would always bring them back to the imaginary journey, and something about doing this would often make him sleepy. This night he decided to retrace his explorations of the Pipeworks. He held his mind to the task for a long time, picturing, with all the clarity he could muster, everything he had seen in that underground realm—the long stairway, the tunnels, the door, the path along the river, the rocks along the path. He felt sleep drawing closer, a heaviness in his limbs, but just as he was about to give in to it, he saw in his mind’s eye the wrinkled rocks that bordered the river at the west end of the Pipeworks, the rocks whose strange ridges and creases had reminded him of writing. His eyes flew open in the dark, his heart began to hammer, and he gave up on sleeping and lay in a state of terrible impatience for the rest of the night."
City of Ember Chapter 14,"The next day was Song Rehearsal Day. Everyone was let off from work at twelve o’clock to practice for the Singing. It was a slow morning for messages. Lina had a lot of time to sit at her station in Garn Square and think. She put her elbows on her knees, rested her chin in her hands, and stared down at the pavement in front of the bench, which was worn smooth by the many feet that had passed there. She thought about the mayor, down in his room full of plunder, gorging on peaches and asparagus and wrapping his huge body in elegant new clothes. She thought of his great stack of light bulbs and shook her head in bewilderment. What was he thinking? If he still had light bulbs when everyone else in Ember had run out, would he enjoy sitting in his lit room while the rest of the city drowned in darkness? And when the power finally ran out for good, all his light bulbs would be useless. Possessions couldn’t save him—how could he have forgotten that? He must be thinking the same way as Looper: everything was hopeless anyhow, so he’d live it up while he could. She leaned back against the bench, stretched her legs out, and took a long breath. Very soon, the guards would storm into the secret room and seize the mayor as he sat stuffing himself on stolen goodies. Maybe they already had. Maybe today the stunning news would come: Mayor Arrested! Stealing from Citizens! Maybe they’d announce it at the Singing, so everyone could hear it. No one came with any messages to be delivered, so after a while Lina left her station and found a step to sit on in an alley off Calloo Street. She pulled back her hair and braided it to keep it from sliding around. Then she took from her pocket the copy of the Instructions she’d made just after she sent her note to the mayor. She unfolded it and began to study it. This is what she was doing when, a little before twelve o’clock, she looked up to see Doon running toward her. He must have come straight from the Pipeworks—he had a big damp patch of water on one leg of his pants. He spoke in an excited rush. “I’ve been looking all over for you!” he said. “I’ve found it!” “Found what?” “The E! At least it looks like an E. It must be an E, though you wouldn’t know it if you weren’t looking for it.…” “You mean the rock marked with an E? In the Pipeworks?” “Yes, yes, I found it!” He stood breathing hard, his eyes blazing. “I’d seen it before, but I didn’t think of it as an E then, just a squiggle that looked like writing. There are all these rocks that look like they’re covered with writing.” “Which rocks? Where is it?” Lina was on her feet now, bouncing with excitement. “Down at the west end of the river. Near where it goes into that great hole in the Pipeworks wall.” He paused, trying to catch his breath. “And listen,” he said. “We could go there right now.” “Right now?” “Yes, because of rehearsals. Everyone’s going home, so the Pipeworks will be closed and empty.” “But if it’s closed, how will we get in?” Grinning, Doon produced a large key from his pocket. “I ducked into the office on my way out and borrowed the spare key,” he said. “Lister—he’s the Pipeworks director—was in the bathroom practicing his singing. He won’t miss the key today. And tomorrow, everyone will be off work.” He did an impatient shuffle. “So come on,” he said. The town clock struck the first of its twelve noontime booms. Lina stuffed her copy of the Instructions back in her pocket. “Let’s go.” — The Pipeworks was empty and silent. Lina and Doon went up the hallway past the rows of boots and the slickers hanging on their hooks. They didn’t take any of these for themselves. This was not a Pipeworks tunnel they were about to enter, they were sure; it wouldn’t be dripping with water or lined with spurting pipes. They went down the long stairway and out into the main tunnel, where the river thundered alongside the path, its dark surface strewn with flecks of light. Doon led the way along the river’s edge. As they neared the west end, Lina saw the rocky outcroppings Doon had described to her. They were strange bulging shapes creased with lines like the faces of the very old. Not far beyond, Lina could see the place where the river disappeared into a great hole in the Pipeworks wall. Doon knelt down beside a clump of stones. He ran a finger over their convoluted surface. “Look here,” he said. Lina stooped down and peered at the deeply carved lines. It was hard to see the E at first, because it was surrounded by such a tangle of other lines, and because she was expecting it to be an E drawn with straight strokes. But once she saw it—an E drawn with curving lines, a script E—she was sure it had been carved on purpose: it was centered on its stone, and its lines were deep and even. “So from here we should look down at the river,” said Doon. “That’s what the Instructions said, ‘down riverbank to ledge.’ ” He lay on his stomach next to the rock and inched forward until his head hung out over the edge of the path. Lina watched him anxiously. His elbows stuck up on either side of him, and his head, bent down, was nearly invisible. He stayed that way for long seconds. Then he shouted, “Yes! I see something!” and scrambled to his feet again. “You do it,” he said. “Look at the riverbank right below us.” Lina did as he had. She lay down and pulled herself forward until her head was over the edge. Eight feet or so below her, she saw the black water churning by. She tucked her chin in and looked at the riverbank. It was a sheer rock wall, straight up and down and slick with spray, and at first that was all she saw. But she kept looking and before long could make out short iron bars bolted into the bank, one below the next, almost directly below her. They were like the rungs of a ladder. They were a ladder, she realized. The bars provided a way to climb down the riverbank. Not a very appealing way—the bars looked slippery, and the water below was so terribly fast. And because of the dimness and the flying spray, she couldn’t actually see if there was a ledge at the bottom or not. But the E was clearly an E, and the bars were clearly a ladder. This must be the right place. “Who’ll go first?” said Doon. “You can,” Lina said, getting to her feet and stepping away. “All right.” Doon turned so that his back was to the river, and he eased himself carefully over the rocks, feeling for the first rung with his foot. Lina watched as he sank out of sight, little by little. After a few moments his voice called up from below: “I’m down! Now you come!” Lina inched backward, just as Doon had, letting one foot dangle over the edge, lower and lower, until it touched the first rung of the ladder. She shifted her weight to that foot, clinging with cold fingers to a ridge in the rock, and lowered herself slowly until she was standing on the rung with both feet. Her heart was beating so hard she was afraid it would shake her fingers loose from their grip. Now she had to move downward. She felt for the next rung with her foot, found it, let herself down. It would have been easy if it hadn’t been for the river waiting below to swallow her. “You’re almost here!” called Doon. His voice came from right below her. “There’s a ledge—one more rung and you’ll feel it.” She did feel it, solid beneath her foot. For a second, she stood there, still clutching the ladder. The surging water was only inches below her now. Don’t think about it, she told herself. She moved sideways two steps to stand next to Doon, and there in front of them was a rectangular space carved out of the river wall, rather like the entry hall of a building. It was perhaps eight feet wide and eight feet high, and would have been invisible from anywhere else in the Pipeworks. You had to have climbed down the riverbank to see it. They stepped into this entry hall and walked a few steps. Enough light to see by came from the tunnel behind them. Lina stopped. “There’s the door!” she said. “What?” said Doon. The water roared so loudly they had to shout to be heard. “The door!” Lina yelled happily. “Yes!” Doon yelled back. “I see it!” At the end of the passage was a wide, solid-looking door. It was dull gray, mottled with greenish and brownish blotches that looked like mildew. Lina put her palms against it. It was metal, and it felt cold. The door had a metal handle, and just below the handle was a keyhole. Lina reached into the pocket of her pants for her copy of the Instructions. She unfolded it, and Doon looked over her shoulder. Together they squinted at the paper in the dim light from the main tunnel. “This is the part, right here,” she said, pointing: Lina ran her finger along line number 3. “This must say, ‘Something something down riverbank to ledge approximately eight feet below.’ That’s what we’ve just done. Then four is something about…‘backs to the water, find door…something.’ And then ‘Ke hind’—that must be ‘key behind,’ and then there’s the small steel pan. Do you see a small steel pan?” Doon was still studying the paper. “It says ‘right.’ We should look to the right of the door.” And quite easily they found it. It wasn’t a pan at all, but a small square of steel embedded in the wall. “A steel panel,” said Lina. She ran her fingers across it and felt a dent at one side. When she pressed there, the panel sprang open easily and silently, as if it were glad to have been finally found. Inside, a silver key was hanging on a hook. Lina reached for it and then drew her hand back. “Shall I do it?” she said. “Or shall you?” “You do it,” said Doon. So she took the key from its hook and put it in the keyhole. She turned it and felt a click. She grasped the door handle and pushed, but nothing happened. She pushed harder. “It won’t budge,” she said. “Maybe it opens outward,” said Doon. Lina pulled. The door still didn’t move. “It has to open,” she said. “We unlocked it!” She pulled and pushed and hauled on the handle—and the door moved, not inward or outward but sideways. “Oh, this is how it goes!” cried Lina. She pulled the handle to the left, and with a deep rasping sound, the door slid away, into a slot in the wall. Behind it was a space of utter darkness. They stared. Lina had expected to see something when the door opened. She had thought there would be light behind it, and a path or road. “Shall we go in?” said Lina. Doon nodded. Lina stepped across the threshold. The air had a dank, stuffy smell. She turned to the right and put her right hand against the wall. It was smooth and flat. The floor, too, was smooth. “There might be a light switch,” she said. She patted the wall just inside the door, from the floor to as high as she could reach, but found nothing. Doon turned left and felt on the other side, with the same result. “Nothing,” he said. Very slowly, keeping a hand to the wall and tapping the floor cautiously with their feet before every step, Doon and Lina made their way in opposite directions. Each of them soon came to a corner and turned again. Now they were going deeper into the dark. They both had the same thought: Is the way out of Ember a long dark tunnel? Must we go mile after mile in absolute darkness? But suddenly Lina gave a yelp of surprise. “Something’s here on the floor,” she said. Her foot had banged against a hard object. She knelt down and touched it cautiously with her hands. It was a metal cube, about a foot square. “It’s a box, I think. Two boxes,” she added as she explored farther. Doon took a step toward her in the darkness, and his knees banged into a hard edge. “There’s something else here, too,” he said. “Not a box.” He ran his hands along it. “It’s big and has a curved edge.” “The boxes are small enough to lift,” said Lina. “Let’s take them out where it’s lighter and see what they are. Come and help.” Doon made his way to Lina and picked up one of the boxes. They walked back through the door and set the boxes down a few feet from the river’s edge. They were made of dark green metal and had gray metal handles on top and a kind of latch on the side. The latches opened easily. Lina and Doon raised the hinged lids and looked inside. What they saw puzzled and disappointed them. Lina’s box was full of smooth white rods, each about ten inches long. At the end of each one, a little bit of string poked out. In Doon’s box were dozens of small packets wrapped in a slippery material. He opened one and found a lot of short wooden sticks, each with a blue blob on the end. Both boxes had a label on the inside of the lid. The label on Lina’s box said “Candles.” The label on Doon’s said “Matches,” and under it was a white, inch-wide strip of some kind of rough, pebbly material. “What does ‘Candles’ mean?” Lina said, puzzled. She took out one of the white rods. It felt slick, almost greasy. “And what does ‘Matches’ mean?” said Doon. “Matches what?” He took one of the small sticks from its packet. The blue stuff on the end was not wood. “Could it be something to write with? Like a pencil? Maybe it writes blue.” “But what’s the point of a whole box of tiny pencils?” asked Lina. “I don’t understand.” Doon frowned at the little blue-tipped stick. “I don’t see what else it could be,” he said finally. “I’ll try writing something with it.” “On what?” Doon looked around. The floor was too damp from the spray of the river to write on. “I could try it on the Instructions,” he said. Lina handed them to him. Carefully, he rubbed the blue end of the stick along the edge of the paper. It didn’t leave a mark. He rubbed it along his arm. No mark there, either. “Try this white stuff,” Lina said, pointing to the white strip inside the lid of the box. He scraped the blue tip across the rough surface. Instantly, the end of the stick burst into flame. Doon cried out and flung the stick away. It landed on the floor a few feet off, where it burned brightly for a moment and then sputtered out. They stared at each other, their mouths open in astonishment. There was a strange sharp smell in the air that smarted in their noses. “It makes fire!” said Doon. “And light!” “Let me try one,” said Lina. She took a stick from the box and ran it across the rough strip. It blazed up fiercely, but she managed to hold on to it for a moment. Then she felt the heat on her fingers and let go, and the flaming stick dropped over the ledge and into the river. “Fire sticks,” said Doon. “Are they what saves Ember?” “I don’t see how they could be,” said Lina. “They’re so small. They go out too fast.” She shivered. This was not turning out the way she’d thought it would. She held up one of the white things. “Anyway, what are these for?” Doon shook his head in bewilderment. “Maybe a candle is a kind of handle,” he said. “Maybe you tie the stick on with the string, and then you can hold it longer while it burns.” “It would still go out just as fast,” Lina said. “Yes,” said Doon. “But it’s all I can think of. Let’s try it.” With a great deal of effort, they looped the string of a rod around one of the sticks. Lina held the rod while Doon scraped the blue tip into flame. They watched the stick flare brightly, making shadows jump up behind them. The wood turned black, and the charred firestick crumbled and dropped to the ground. But the light didn’t go out. The string itself had caught fire. As they watched, it sputtered and smoked and then burned steadily, filling the little room with a warm glow. “It’s the movable light,” said Doon in awe. All Lina’s excitement flooded back. “And now, and now—” she said, “we can go back into the room and see what’s there.” They went back down the passage to the doorway and stepped inside. Lina held the movable light at arm’s length before her. In its flickering glow they saw something made of silvery metal. They walked slowly around, examining it. It was long and low, filling up the center of the room. One end of it came to a point. The other end was flat. Across the open middle stretched two metal strips. Four stout ropes were attached to the outside, one at each end and one on each side. And on the floor of the thing were two poles, each flattened at one end. “Look,” said Lina. “There’s a word on its side.” They squatted at the pointed end and held the flame near the word. It said, in square black letters, “BOAT.” “Boat,” repeated Doon. “What does that mean?” “I don’t know,” said Lina. “And here’s another word, on these poles: ‘Paddles.’ The only paddle I know is the one Mrs. Polster uses on kids who misbehave in school.” Once again, she took her copy of the Instructions from her pocket and consulted it, holding it in the light of the flame. “Look,” she said, “right here: ‘oat’ must be ‘boat.’ ” “And the next part must say, ‘stocked with necessary equipment,” said Doon. “That must be what’s in the boxes.” “Then there’s this.” Lina ran her finger along the next line. “This word must be ‘ropes,’ ” she said. “Then ‘lower’…and then…would this word be ‘downstairs’? Maybe it says, ‘head downstairs’?” “That doesn’t make sense,” said Doon. “There aren’t any stairs, except the ones that go up.” He frowned at the word, and then he took a short, sharp breath. “Downstream,” he said. “The word must be ‘downstream.’ It must say something like, ‘Use the ropes to lower the boat, and head downstream.’ ” He looked up at Lina and spoke in a voice full of wonder. “The boat goes on the water. It’s something to ride in.” They stared at each other in the flickering light, realizing what this meant. There was no tunnel leading out of Ember. The way out was the river. To leave Ember, they must go on the river."
City of Ember Chapter 15,"“But this can’t be right,” said Doon. “If the river is the way out of Ember, why is there just one boat? It’s only big enough for two people.” “I don’t know,” said Lina. “It is strange.” “Let’s look around some more.” They stood up. Doon went back to where they’d left the boxes and got another candle. He brought it into the boat room and lit it, and the room grew twice as bright. Right away they saw what they hadn’t noticed before: in the back wall was a door almost as wide as the whole room. When they went up to it they could see that it, too, was a sliding door. Doon took hold of the handle that was on the right and pulled sideways, and the door rolled smoothly open to reveal more darkness. They stepped in. They could guess from the echoing sound of their voices when they spoke that they were in a tremendous room, though the ceiling was low—they could see it just over their heads. The candlelight glinted off something shiny, and as they went in farther they could see that the room was filled with boats, row upon row of them, all just like the one in the first room. “There must be hundreds,” Lina whispered. “Enough for everyone, I suppose,” said Doon. They wandered around a bit, but there wasn’t really much to see. All the boats were the same. Each one contained two metal boxes and two paddles. The room was cold, and the air felt heavy in their lungs. The candle flames burned weakly. So they went back to the small room and slid the door closed behind them. “I guess,” said Lina, “that this first boat is meant as a sort of sample. We learn what’s what on the one that has signs. ‘Boat.’ ‘Paddles.’ ‘Candles.’ ‘Matches.’ ” They went back out to the river’s edge. Lina blew out her candle and began closing up the boxes they’d opened. Doon blew out his, too. “I’m going to take my candle with me,” he said, “to look at later. I want some matches as well.” He took a packet of matches from the box and tucked it inside his shirt. Lina returned the boxes to the boat room and slid the door closed. Then she and Doon stood together on the ledge and gazed down. Less than a foot below, the river rushed by. A short distance downstream it plunged into the dark mouth in the wall and disappeared. “Well,” he said, “we’ve found it.” “We’ve found it,” Lina repeated, wonderingly. “And tomorrow, at the start of the Singing,” said Doon, “we’ll stand up in Harken Square and tell the whole city.” — When they came up out of the Pipeworks, it was nearly six o’clock. They hadn’t realized they’d been down there so long; both Doon’s father and Mrs. Murdo would be wondering where they were. They stood for a moment under a lamppost, just long enough to agree on a time to meet the next day and plan their announcement. Then they hurried home. When Doon’s father asked why he was so late, he said his song rehearsal had gone long. He wanted to shout out to his father, We’ve found the way out! We’re saved! But he held himself in for the sake of his moment of glory. Tomorrow, when his father saw him on the steps of the Gathering Hall, he would be so overcome with surprise and pride that he would go weak in the knees, and the people standing next to him would have to catch him and hold him up. And the announcement about the thieving mayor! That would probably happen tomorrow, too. Doon had almost forgotten it in the excitement of finding the boats. The mayor’s arrest and the city’s rescue, both at once! It was going to be an amazing day. Racing thoughts kept Doon awake almost until morning. The day of the Singing was a holiday for the entire city; all the stores and other businesses were closed. This meant that Doon didn’t have to go to the Pipeworks. His father didn’t have to go to his shop, either, but he was going to go anyhow. If he wasn’t in his shop, fussing with his merchandise, he didn’t know what to do with himself. Doon dawdled over his breakfast of carrot sticks and mashed turnips, waiting for his father to go. He wanted to get ready for the journey down the river. They probably wouldn’t leave for a few days—he and Lina would make their announcement tonight, and people would need time to get organized before they could leave the city—but he was too excited to sit around doing nothing. As soon as his father left, Doon slipped the case off his pillow. This would be his traveling pack. He put in the candle and the matches. He put in the key he’d borrowed from the Pipeworks office. He put in a good-sized piece of rope that he’d found at the trash heaps and had been saving for years and a bottle for water. He put in an ancient folding knife that his father had given him, which had come down through generations of his family and which he used to chop off his bangs when they got so long they tickled his eyelids. He put in some extra clothes, in case he got wet, and some paper and a pencil, so that he could write a record of the journey. Along with these things, he crammed in a small blanket—it might be cold in the new city—and a packet of food: six carrots, a handful of vitamins, some peas and mushrooms wrapped in a lettuce leaf, two boiled beets, and two boiled turnips. That should be enough. Surely, when they got to where they were going, the people who lived there would give them something to eat. He tied the top of the pillowcase in a knot, and then he untied it again. He might want to add something else. He stood in the middle of the apartment and looked around at the jumble of stuff. There was nothing else here that he wanted to take with him—no, there was one thing. He went back into his room. From beneath his bed he pulled out the pages of his bug book. He leafed through it. The white spider. The moth with the zigzag pattern on its wings. The bee, striped brown and yellow on its rear end. He looked at his drawings for a long time, memorizing their beauty and strangeness. Tiny fringes of hair, minute claws, jointed legs. Should he take this with him? There might not be creatures like this where they were going. He might never see such things again. But no, he’d leave it behind—his pack should be small and light. He put the bug book back under his bed and pulled out the box where he kept the green worm. He drew back the scarf to check his captive one more time. Several days before, the worm had done a curious thing: it had wrapped itself up in a blanket of threads. Since then it had hung motionless from a bit of cabbage stem. Doon had been watching it carefully. Either it was dead, or it was undergoing the change that he’d read about in a library book but could hardly believe was true—the change from a crawling thing to a flying thing. So far, the bundled-up worm had shown no signs of life. But now he saw that it was wriggling. The whole wrapped-up bundle, which was shaped like a large vitamin pill, bent slightly from side to side, then was still, then bent back and forth again. Something was pushing at the top end of it, and in a moment the threads there split apart and a dark furry knob emerged. Doon watched, holding his breath. Next came two hairlike legs, which clawed and plucked at the blanket. In a few minutes the whole creature was out. Egress, thought Doon with a smile. The creature’s wings were crushed flat against its body at first, but soon they opened, and Doon saw what his green worm had become: a moth with light brown wings. He lifted the box and carried it to the window. He opened the window and held the box out into the air. The moth waved its feathery feelers and took a few steps along the wilted cabbage leaf. For several minutes, it stood still, its wings trembling slightly. Then it fluttered up into the air, rising higher and higher until it was just a pale spot against the dark sky. Doon watched until the moth disappeared. He knew he had seen something marvelous. What was the power that turned the worm into a moth? It was greater than any power the Builders had had, he was sure of that. The power that ran the city of Ember was feeble by comparison—and about to run out. For a few minutes he stood by the window, looking out over the square and thinking again about what to pack for his journey. Should he put in anything like nails or wire? Would he need money? Should he take some soap? Then he laughed and struck a hand against his head. He kept forgetting that the entire population of the city would be with him on the trip. If he needed something he didn’t have, someone would surely be able to supply it. So he tied a knot in his pillowcase and was about to close the window when he caught sight of three burly men wearing the red and brown uniform of the city guards striding into the square. They stopped and looked around for a moment. Then one of them confronted old humpbacked Nammy Proggs, who was standing not far from the entrance to the Small Items shop. The guard towered over her, and she twisted her head sideways and squinted up at him. Doon could hear the guard’s voice clearly: “We’re looking for a boy named Harrow.” “Why?” said Nammy. “Spreading vicious rumors” was the answer. “Do you know where he is?” Nammy hesitated a moment, and then she said, “Went off to the trash heaps just a minute ago.” The guard nodded curtly and beckoned to his companions. They marched away. Spreading vicious rumors! Doon was so stunned that he stood still as stone for a long minute. What could they possibly mean? But there was only one answer. It had to be what they’d told the assistant guard about the mayor. Why were they calling it a vicious rumor? It was the truth! He didn’t understand it. He did understand, though, that Nammy Proggs had done him a favor. She must have seen that the guards meant him no good. She had protected him, at least for the moment, by sending the guards to the wrong place. Doon forced his mind to slow down and think. Why did the guards think he and Lina were lying? Obviously, they hadn’t investigated the room in Tunnel 351. If they had, they’d have known he and Lina were telling the truth. He could think of only one other possibility. The guards—at least some of them— already knew what the mayor was doing. They knew about it and wanted it to stay a secret. And why? It was clear: the guards, too, were getting things from the storerooms. It had to be the answer. For a moment, the fear he’d felt when he saw the guards was replaced by rage. The familiar hot wave rose in him, and he wanted to grab a handful of his father’s nails or pot shards and throw them against the wall. But all at once he remembered: if the guards were after him, they’d be after Lina, too. He had to warn her. He dashed down the stairs, his anger turning into power for his running feet. — After discovering the room full of boats, Lina had come home to Mrs. Murdo’s with the sound of the river still in her ears. It was like a huge, powerful voice, roaring at the top of its lungs. Deep inside herself Lina felt an answering call, as if she, too, contained a drop of the same power. She would ride on the river—she could hardly believe it—and it might take her to the shining city she had dreamed of, or it might drown her. What she had imagined before—the smooth, gently sloping path leading out—now seemed childish. How could the way into a new world be so easy? She dreaded going on the river, but she was ready for it, too. She longed to go. She slept that night in the beautiful blue-green room, in the big, lumpy bed with Poppy next to her. She felt safe here. Mrs. Murdo came in and tucked the covers around her. She sat on the edge of the bed and sang an odd little song to Poppy—something about rock-abye baby, in the treetops. “What are treetops?” Lina asked, but Mrs. Murdo didn’t know. “It’s a very old song,” she said. “It’s probably nonsense words.” She said good night and went out into the living room, where Lina could hear her humming quietly as she tidied up. She was so orderly. She never left her stockings draped over the back of a chair, or her sewing spread out all over the table. Lina closed her eyes and waited for sleep. But her thoughts kept tumbling around. So much was going to happen tomorrow—the whole city would be in an uproar. People would stream down into the Pipeworks to see the boats. They’d be excited, shouting and laughing and crying, packing up their belongings, and surging through the streets. If they couldn’t all fit into the boats, there would be fights. Some people might get hurt. It was going to be a mess. She’d have to keep her little family close around her—Poppy, Mrs. Murdo, and Doon, and perhaps Doon’s father and Clary. Through it all, she would hold tight to Poppy so no harm could come to her. — It seemed she had barely closed her eyes when she felt Poppy’s hard little heels banging against her shins. “Time-a get up! Get up!” Poppy chirped. She got out of bed and dressed herself and Poppy. In the kitchen, Mrs. Murdo was mashing potatoes for breakfast. How lovely, Lina thought, to have breakfast cooked for her—to hear water bubbling in the pot, and to find a bowl and a spoon set out on the table, and vitamins lined up neatly beside a cup of beet tea. I could live here forever, Lina thought, before she remembered that in a day or two they would all be leaving. There was a sudden banging on the front door. Mrs. Murdo dried her hands and went to answer it, but before she’d taken three steps the banging came again. “I’m coming, I’m coming,” Mrs. Murdo cried, and when she opened the door, there was Doon. His face was flushed, and he was breathing hard. He had a bulging pillowcase slung over his shoulder. He looked past Mrs. Murdo to Lina. “I have to talk to you,” he said. “Right now, but…” He threw a doubtful glance at Mrs. Murdo. Lina scrambled up from the table. “In here,” she said, towing him toward the bluegreen room. When she had closed the door, Doon told her what had happened. “They’ll come for you, too,” he said, “any minute. We have to get out of here. We have to hide from them.” Lina could hardly make sense of what he was saying. They were in trouble? Her legs went shaky at the knees. “Hide?” she said. “Hide where?” “We could go to the school—no one would be there today—or the library. It’s almost always open, even on holidays.” He hopped impatiently from foot to foot. “But we have to go fast, we have to go now. They have signs up about us all over the city!” “Signs?” “Telling people to report us if they see us!” Lina felt as if a swarm of insects was inside her head, buzzing so loudly she couldn’t think. “How long do we have to hide? All day?” “I don’t know—we don’t have time to think about it. Lina, they could be outside the door this minute.” The urgency in his voice convinced her. On the way through the living room she gave Poppy a quick kiss and called, “Bye, Mrs. Murdo. We have some emergency work to do. If anyone comes asking for me, say I’ll be back later.” They were down the stairs before Mrs. Murdo could ask any questions. Once in the street, they ran. “Where to?” Lina said. “The school,” Doon answered. They took Greystone Street, staying within the shadows as much as they could. As they passed the shoe shop, Lina saw a white piece of paper stuck up on the window. She glanced at it and her heart gave a wild jump. Her name and Doon’s were written on it in big black letters: DOON HARROW AND LINAMAYFLEET WANTED FOR SPREADING VICIOUS RUMORS IF YOU SEE THEM, REPORT TO MAYOR’S CHIEF GUARD. BELIEVE NOTHING THEY SAY. REWARD She snatched the poster off the window, crumpled it up, and tossed it into the nearest trash can. In the next block, she tore down two more, and Doon ripped one off a lamppost. But there were too many to get them all, and they didn’t have time to waste. They ran faster. On this holiday, people slept late, and because the stores were closed, the streets were nearly empty. Still, they took the long route all the way out by the beehives to avoid Sparkswallow Square, where a few people might be standing around and talking. They ran past the greenhouses and up Dedlock Street. As they crossed Night Street, Lina glanced to her left. Two blocks away, a couple of guards were crossing to Greengate Square. She tapped Doon’s shoulder and pointed. He saw, and they ran faster. Had they been noticed? Lina thought not; they would have heard a shout if the guards had seen them. They got to the school and went in through the back door. In the Wide Hallway, their footsteps echoed on the wooden floor. It was strange to be here again, and to be here alone, without the clatter and chatter of other children. The hallway with its eight doors seemed smaller to Lina than it had when she was a student, and shabbier. The planks of the floor were scuffed gray, and there was a cloud of finger smudges around the doorknob of every door. They went into Miss Thorn’s room and, out of habit, sat at their old desks. “I don’t think they’ll look for us here,” said Doon. “If they do, we can crawl into the paper cabinet.” He set his pack down next to him on the floor. For a while they just sat there, getting their breath back. They hadn’t turned the light on, so the room was dim—the only light came from beneath the blind over the window. “Those posters,” Lina said after a while. “Yes. Everyone will see them.” “What will they do to us if they catch us?” “I don’t know. Something to keep us from telling what we know. Put us in the Prison Room, maybe.” Lina ran her finger along the B carved in the desktop. It felt like a very long time since she’d last sat at this desk. “We can’t hide in here forever,” she said. “No,” said Doon. “Just until it’s time for the Singing. Then when everyone is gathered in Harken Square, we’ll go and tell about the boats and the mayor. Won’t we? I haven’t really thought about it—I haven’t had a chance to think at all this morning.” “But the guards are always there at the Singing, standing next to the mayor,” said Lina. “They’d grab us as soon as we opened our mouths.” Doon’s eyebrows came together in a dark line. “You’re right. So what will we do?” It was like finding yourself on a dead-end street, Lina thought. There was no way out. She stared blankly at the things that had once been her daily companions—the teacher’s desk, the stacks of paper, The Book of the City of Ember on its special shelf. The old words ran through her head: “There is no place but Ember. Ember is the only light in the dark world.” She knew now that this wasn’t true. There was someplace else—the place where the boats would take them. As if Doon had read her thoughts, he looked up. “We could go.” “Go where?” she said, though she knew right away what he meant. “Wherever the river leads,” he said. He gestured to the pillowcase sack. “I packed up my bag this morning—I’m all ready. I’m sure I have enough for you, too.” Lina felt her heart shrink a little. “Go by ourselves?” she said. “Without telling anyone?” “We will tell them.” Doon was on his feet now. He went to the cabinet and got a sheet of paper. “We’ll write a note explaining everything—a note to someone we trust, someone who’ll believe us.” “But I can’t just leave,” said Lina. “How could I leave Poppy? And not even say goodbye to her? Not know where I’m going, or if I’m ever coming back? How could you go without saying goodbye to your father?” “Because,” said Doon, “once they find the boats, the rest of Ember will follow us. It’s not as if we’re leaving them forever.” He strode across the room and rummaged in Miss Thorn’s desk. “Who shall we write the message to?” Lina wasn’t sure about this idea, but she couldn’t, at the moment, think of a better one. So she said, “We could write it to Clary. She’s seen the Instructions. She’ll believe what we say. And she lives close by—just up in Torrick Square.” “Okay,” said Doon. He pulled a pencil from the desk drawer. “Really,” he said, “this is a perfect idea. We can get away from the guards and leave our message behind us. And we can be the first ones to arrive in the new city! We should be the first, because we discovered the way.” “Well, that’s true.” Lina thought for a minute. “How long do you think it will take before the rest of them find the boats and come? It’s a lot of people to get organized.” She numbered on her fingers the things that would have to happen. “Clary will have to get the head of the Pipeworks to go down with her and find the boats. Then she’ll have to make the announcement to the city. Then everyone in Ember will have to pack up their things, troop down to the river, get all those boats out of that big room, and load themselves in. It could be a big mess, Doon. Poppy will need me.” She pictured frenzied crowds of people, and Poppy tiny and lost among them. “Poppy has Mrs. Murdo,” said Doon. “She’ll be fine. Really. Mrs. Murdo is very organized.” It was true. The thought of taking Poppy with her on the river, which had darted into Lina’s mind, darted out again. I’m only being selfish, she thought, to want to have her with me. It’s too dangerous to take her. Mrs. Murdo will bring her in a day or two. This seemed the most sensible plan, though it made her so sad that it cast a shadow over the thrill of going to the new city. “What if something goes wrong?” she said. “Nothing will go wrong! It’s a good plan, Lina. We’ll be there ahead of everyone else— we can welcome them when they come, we can show them around!” Doon was bursting with eagerness. His eyes shone, and he jiggled up and down. “Well, all right,” Lina said. “Let’s write our message, then.” Doon wrote for a long time. When he was finished, he showed what he’d written to Lina. He’d explained how to find the rock with the E, how to go down to the boat room, even how to use the candles. “It’s good,” she said. “Now we have to deliver it.” She paused a moment to see if she had any courage inside her. She found that she did, along with sadness and fear and excitement. “I’ll deliver it,” she said. “I’m the messenger, after all. I know back ways to go, where no one will see me.” An idea struck her. “Doon, maybe Clary will be home! Maybe she would keep us safe and help us tell what we know, and we won’t have to leave right now.” Doon quickly shook his head. “I doubt it,” he said. “She’s probably with her singing group, getting ready. You’ll just have to leave the note under her door.” Lina could tell from his tone of voice that Doon didn’t really want Clary to be home. She supposed he had his heart set on their going down the river by themselves. Doon glanced up at the clock on the schoolroom wall. “It’s a little after two,” he said. “The Singing begins at three. After that, everyone will be in Harken Square and the streets will be empty. I think we can get to the Pipeworks safely then—why don’t we leave about a quarter after three.” “You still have the key?” Doon nodded. “So after I’ve delivered the note to Clary, I’ll come back here,” said Lina. “Yes. And then we’ll wait until three-fifteen, and then we’ll go.” Lina got up from the cramped desk and went to the window. She moved the blind a little and peered out. There was no one in the street. The dusty schoolroom was very quiet. She thought about Doon’s father, who would be frantic when he saw his son’s name on those posters and then realized later that Doon had disappeared. She thought about Mrs. Murdo, who might already have seen the posters, and who would be frightened if guards came looking for Lina and terrified if Lina didn’t come home by nightfall. She tried not to think about Poppy at all; she couldn’t bear it. “Give me the note,” she said to Doon at last. She folded the piece of paper carefully and put it in the pocket of her pants. “Back soon,” she said, and went out of the room and down the hall to the rear door of the school. Doon went to the window to watch her go. He moved the blind aside just enough to see out into Pibb Street. There she was, running in that long-legged way, with her hair flying. She started across Stonegrit Lane. Just before she reached the other side, Doon’s breath stopped in his throat. Two guards rounded the corner from Knack Street, directly ahead of her. One of them was the chief guard. He leapt forward and shouted so loudly Doon could hear him plainly through the glass: “That’s her! Get her!” Lina reversed her direction in an instant. She raced back down Pibb Street, turned down School Street toward Bilbollio Square, and vanished from Doon’s sight. The guards ran after her, shouting. Doon watched, sick with horror. She’s much faster than they are, he told himself. She’ll lose them—she knows places to hide. He stood frozen next to the window, hardly breathing. They won’t catch her, he thought. I’m sure they won’t catch her."
City of Ember Chapter 16,"When Lina heard the guards shout, terror shot through her. She ran faster than she ever had before, her heart pounding wildly. Behind her, the guards kept up their shouting, and she knew that if other guards were nearby they would come running. She had to find a hiding place. Ahead of her was Bilbollio Square—was there a spot she could duck into? And like an answer, Doon’s words came back to her: “The library. It’s almost always open, even on holidays.” She didn’t have time to think. She didn’t ask herself whether Edward Pocket would be willing to hide her, or whether there would even be a good place to hide in the library. She just ran for the passageway that led to the library door and darted down it. But the library door wouldn’t open. She turned the knob frantically, she pulled and pushed, and then, at the same time that she heard the running footsteps of the guards coming into the square, she saw the small handwritten sign stuck to the door: “Closed for the Singing.” The guards were very near now. If she ran, they would see her. She flattened herself against the wall, hoping they wouldn’t think to look in the library passage. But they did. “Here she is!” yelled one of the guards. She tried to shoot past him, but the passage was too narrow, and he caught her by the arm. She pulled and twisted and kicked, but the chief guard had her now, too. He gripped her other arm with fingers that felt like iron. “Stop your struggling!” he shouted. Lina reached up and grabbed a handful of his wiry beard. She pulled with all her might, and the chief guard roared, but he didn’t let go. He yanked her forward, almost off the ground, and the two guards dragged her across the square at an awkward, lopsided pace that made her stumble over her own feet. “You’re hurting me!” Lina said. “Don’t hold so tight!” “Don’t you tell us what to do,” said the chief guard. “We’ll hold you tight till we get you where you’re going.” “Where is that?” said Lina. She was so enraged at her bad luck that she almost forgot to be afraid. “You’re going to see the mayor, missy,” said the chief guard. “He’ll decide what to do with you.” “But I haven’t done anything wrong!” “Spreading vicious rumors,” said the guard. “Telling dangerous lies calculated to cause civic unrest.” “It’s not a lie!” she said. But the guard gripped her arm even more tightly and gave her a shove so she stumbled sideways. “No talking,” he said, and they walked the rest of the way in grim silence. A few people had already gathered in Harken Square, though the workers were still getting it ready for the Singing. Street-sweepers crossed the square back and forth, pushing their brooms. Someone appeared at a second-floor window of a building on Gilly Street and unfurled one of the banners that was always displayed for the Singing—a long piece of red cloth, faded after years of use but still showing its design of wavy lines, representing the river, the source of all power. That was for “The Song of the River.” There would be a banner on the Broad Street side of the square, too, this one deep yellowgold with a design like a grid to represent “The Song of the City,” and another banner on the Otterwill side for “The Song of Darkness,” perfectly black except for a narrow yellow edge. The guards marched Lina up the steps of the Gathering Hall and through the wide doorway. They took her down the main corridor, opened the door at the end, and gave her one last push, a push that caused her to stagger forward in an undignified way and bump up against the back of a chair. It was the same room she’d been in that other, much happier day—her first day as a messenger. Nothing had changed—the frayed red curtains, the armchairs with the upholstery worn thin, the hideous mud-colored carpet. The portraits on the wall looked down at her sorrowfully. “Sit there,” said the chief guard. He pointed at a small, hard-looking chair that faced the large armchair. Lina sat. Next to the chair was the small table she remembered from before, with the china teapot and a tray of china teacups with chips around their edges. The chief guard left the room—to find the mayor, Lina supposed. The other one stood silently with his arms folded across his chest. Nothing happened for a while. Lina tried to think about what she would say to the mayor, but her mind wouldn’t work. Then the door to the front hall opened, and the mayor came in. It was the first time Lina had seen him up close since she had delivered Looper’s message to him. He seemed even more immense. His baggy face was the color of a mushroom. He wore a black suit that stretched only far enough across his vast belly for one button to connect with its buttonhole. He moved ponderously across the room and settled into the armchair, filling it completely. Next to his chair was a table, and on the table was a brass bell the size of a fist. The mayor gazed for a moment at Lina with eyes that looked like the openings of tunnels, and then he turned to the guard. “Dismissed,” he said, waving the back of his hand at him. “Return when I ring the bell.” The guard left. The mayor swung his gaze back to Lina. “I am not surprised,” he said. He lifted one arm and pointed a finger at Lina’s face. “You have been in trouble before. Going where you shouldn’t.” Lina started to speak, but the mayor held up his hand. It was an oddly small hand, with short fingers like ripe pea pods. “Curiosity,” said the mayor. “A dangerous quality. Unhealthy. Especially regrettable in one so young.” “I’m twelve,” said Lina. “Silence!” said the mayor. “I am speaking.” He wriggled slightly from side to side, wedging himself more firmly into the chair. He’ll need to be pried out of it, Lina thought. “Ember, as you know,” the mayor went on, “is in a time of difficulty. Extraordinary measures are necessary. This is a time when citizens should be most loyal. Most lawabiding. For the good of all.” Lina said nothing. She watched how the flesh under the mayor’s chin bulged in and out as he spoke, and then she turned her eyes from this unpleasant sight and looked carefully around the room. She was thinking now, calculating, but not about what the mayor was saying. “The duties of a mayor,” said the mayor, “are…complex. Cannot be understood by regular citizens, particularly children. That is why…,” he went on, leaning slightly forward so that his stomach pushed farther out along his lap, “certain things must remain hidden from the public. The public would not understand. The public must have faith,” said the mayor, once again holding up his hand, this time with a finger pointing to the ceiling, “that all is being done for their benefit. For their own good.” “Hogwash,” said Lina. The mayor jerked backward. His eyebrows came down over his eyes, making them into dark slits. “What?” he said. “Surely I heard you incorrectly.” “I said hogwash,” said Lina. “It means—” “Do not presume to tell me what it means!” the mayor cried. “Impudence will make things worse for you.” He was breathing heavily, and his words came out with spaces between them. “A misguided child…such as yourself…requires…a forceful lesson.” His short fingers gripped the arms of the chair. “Perhaps,” he said, “your curiosity has led you to wonder…about the Prison Room. What could it be like, eh? Dark? Cold? Uncomfortable?” He made the smile that Lina remembered from Assignment Day. His lips pulled away from his small teeth; his gray cheeks folded. “You will have a chance to find out. You will become…closely acquainted…with the Prison Room. The guards will escort you there. Your accomplice—another known troublemaker—will join you, as soon as he is located.” The mayor turned to look for the bell. This was the moment when Lina had planned to make a dash for freedom—she thought she had a slim chance to succeed if she moved fast enough—but something happened in that instant that gave her a head start. The lights went out. There was no flicker this time, just sudden, complete darkness. It was fortunate that Lina had already planned her move and knew exactly which way to go. She leapt up, knocking over her chair. With her arm, she made a wide swipe and knocked over the table next to the chair as well. The furniture thumping to the floor, the teapot shattering, and the mayor’s enraged shouts made a clamor that covered the sound of her footsteps as she dashed to the stairway door. Was it unlocked? She reached for the knob. Grunts and squeaks told her that the mayor was struggling to rise from his chair. She turned the knob and pulled, and the door sprang open. She closed the door behind her and leapt upward two steps at a time. Even in the pitch dark, she could climb stairs. In the room, the bell clanged and clanged, and the mayor bellowed. When she got to the first landing, she heard the guards shouting. There was a crash— someone must have fallen over the toppled chair or table. “Where is she?” someone yelled. “Must have run out the door!” Did they know which door? She didn’t hear footsteps behind her. If she could make it to the roof—and if from the roof she could jump to the roof of the Prison Room and from there to the street—then maybe she could escape. Her lungs were on fire now, her breath was burning her throat, but she climbed without stopping, and when she came to the top, she burst through the door to the roof and ran out. And that was when the lights came back on. It was as if the blackout had been arranged especially for her. I am so lucky, she thought, so extremely lucky! Ahead of her was the clock tower. She went around to the other side of it. No dancing on the roof this time. A low wall ran along the edge of the building. Lina approached it cautiously and peered out over the swarm of people assembling in Harken Square. Directly below her was the entrance of the Gathering Hall, and as she watched, two guards dashed out the door and down the steps. Good—they had gone the wrong way! They must think she’d escaped into the crowd. For the moment, she was safe. The clock in the tower began to chime. Three great booms rang out. It was time for the Singing to begin. Lina gazed down at the people of Ember, gathered to sing their songs. They stood so close together that she could see only their faces, which were lifted up toward the sky, with the hard bright lights shining down on them. They were silent, waiting for the Songmaster to appear on the Gathering Hall steps. There was a strange hush, as if the city were holding its breath. Of the whole Ember year, Lina thought, this hush before the Singing was one of the most exciting moments. She remembered other years, when she had stood with her parents, too short to see the Songmaster’s signal, too short to see anything but people’s backs and legs, and waited for the first note to thunder out. She felt her heart move at that moment, every year. The sound would rise in waves around her like water, almost as if it could lift her off the ground. Now suddenly the moment came again. From hundreds of voices rose the first notes of “The Song of the City,” deep and strong. She felt as she had all the years before: a quivering inside, as though a string under her ribs had been plucked, and a rush of joy and sadness mixed together. The deep, rumbling chords of the song filled Harken Square. Lina felt that she might step off the edge of the building and walk across the air, it seemed so solid with sound. “The Song of the City” was long—there were verses about “streets of light and walls of stone,” about “citizens with sturdy hearts,” about “stored abundance never-ending.” (Not true, Lina thought.) But at last, “The Song of the City” wound down to its end. The singers held the final note, which grew softer and softer, and then there was silence again. Lina looked out at the lighted streets spreading away in every direction, the streets she knew so well. She loved her city, worn out and crumbling though it was. She looked up at the clock: ten minutes after three. Doon would be getting ready to leave for the Pipeworks. She didn’t know whether he’d seen her being captured—if he had, he would be wondering if she’d been locked into the Prison Room. He’d be wondering if he should try to rescue her, or if he should go down the river by himself. She should be hurrying to join him—but a sadness held her back, like a heavy stone in her chest. She bent her face into the palms of her hands and pressed hard against her closed eyes. How could she go away from Ember and leave Poppy behind? Because if she went, she must leave Poppy behind, mustn’t she? How could she take her on a journey of such danger? “The Song of the River” startled her when it began—the men’s voices, low and rolling, swelling with power, and then the women’s voices coming in above with a complicated melody that seemed to fight the current. Lina listened, unable to move. “The Song of the River” made her uneasy—it always had. With its rolling, relentless rhythm, it seemed to urge her onward, saying, Go down, go away, go now. The more she listened, the more she felt something like the motion of the river in her stomach, a churning, sickening feeling. Then came “The Song of Darkness,” the last of the three songs, and the one most filled with longing and majesty. The soul of Ember was in this song. Its tremendous chords held all the sorrow and all the strength of the people of the city. The song reached its climax: “Darkness like an endless night,” sang the hundreds of voices, so powerfully the air seemed to shiver. And at that moment, the lights once more went out. The voices faltered, but only for an instant. Then they rose again in the darkness, stronger even than before. Lina sang, too. She stood up and sang with all her might into the deep, solid blackness. The last notes echoed and faded into a terrible silence. Lina stood utterly still. Will it end like this, she thought, at the finish of the last song? She felt the cold stone of the clock tower behind her back. She waited. Then an idea came to her that made her skin prickle. What if she were to shout into the silence right now? What if she were to say, Listen, people! We’ve found the way out of Ember! It’s the river—we go on the river! She could announce the astounding news, just as she and Doon had planned to do, and then—and then what would happen? Would the guards rush to the roof and seize her? Would the people in the square think her news was just a child’s wishful thinking, or would they listen and be saved? She could feel the words pushing upward in her throat, she wanted so much to say them. She took a deep breath and leaned forward. But before she could speak, a rumble of voices arose below. Someone shouted, “Don’t move!” and someone else shrieked. The rumble rose to a roar, and then cries flew into the darkness from everywhere. The crowd was erupting into panic. There was no hope of being heard now. Lina clutched the edge of the clock tower as if the tumult below might cause her to fall. She strained her eyes against the darkness. Without light, she could go nowhere. Lights, come back on, she prayed. Come back on. Then she saw something. At first, she thought her eyes were tricking her. She closed them tightly and opened them again. It was still there: a tiny point of light, moving. As she watched, it moved along slowly in a straight line. Then it turned and moved in a straight line again. Was it on River Road? She couldn’t tell. But suddenly she knew what it was. It was Doon, with a candle. Doon, going toward the Pipeworks in the dark. And she wanted to go, too. She could feel it all through her, the urge to run and meet him and find the way out of Ember, to the new place. She listened to the shouts and wails of the terrified people in the square below. She thought of Mrs. Murdo down there in the dark, being bumped and pushed, with her arms wrapped tightly around Poppy, trying to protect her, and all at once everything seemed clear. Lina knew what she would do—if only the lights would come back on, if only this was not the very last blackout in the history of Ember. Watching the tiny light following its steady course, she made a wish with the whole force of her heart and mind. Then the floodlights flickered—there was a great cry of hope from the crowd—and the lights came on and stayed on. Lina ran to the back edge of the roof, dropped easily down onto the roof of the Prison Room, and, seeing no guards in the crowd that was now streaming into the street, she jumped from there to the ground and joined the throng of people. She made her way down Greystone Street, going at the same pace as everyone else so she wouldn’t stand out. When she came to the trash-can enclosure behind the Gathering Hall, she squatted down and hid. Her heart was beating fast, but she felt strong and purposeful now. She had her plan. As soon as she spotted Mrs. Murdo and Poppy on their way home, she’d put it into action."
City of Ember Chapter 17,"At three-twenty, Doon took his pillowcase pack, left the school by the back door, and started up Pibb Street. He went fast—the lights had gone out for a few minutes just before three, and he was nervous about being outside. He planned to take the long way to the Pipeworks, out at the very edge of the city, to avoid any guards that might still be looking for him. He was filled with dread about Lina. He wouldn’t know what had happened to her until he got to the Pipeworks and she either showed up or didn’t. All he could do now was run. He raced down Knack Street. It was strange to be out in the city with the streets so utterly deserted. Without the people passing back and forth, the streets seemed wider and darker. Nothing moved but himself, his shadow, and his fleeting reflection in shop windows he passed. In Selverton Square, he saw a kiosk where the poster with his and Lina’s names on it had been pinned up. Everyone in the city must have seen these posters by now. He was famous, he thought wryly, but not in the way he’d wanted. There would be no glorious moment on the Gathering Hall steps after all. Instead of making his father proud, he would cause him dreadful worry. This thought made him so sad that his knees felt suddenly wobbly. How could he just vanish without a word? But it was too late now, he couldn’t go back. If only there was some way to send him a message—and in a moment, he realized there was. He stopped, fished in his pack for the paper and pencil he had brought, and scribbled on it, “Father— We have found the way out—it was in the Pipeworks after all! You will know about it tomorrow. Love, Doon.” He folded this in quarters, wrote “Deliver to Loris Harrow” in big letters on the outside, and pinned it to the kiosk. There! That was the best he could do. He would have to trust that someone would deliver it. In the distance, he heard the faint sound of singing. He listened—it was “The Song of the River,” just ending. “Far below, like the blood of the earth, From the center of nowhere rushing forth,” he sang under his breath. Like everyone in Ember, he knew the words of the three songs by heart. He sang along softly with the faraway singers: “Making the light for the lamps of Ember, Older than anyone can remember, Faster than anything anyone knows, The river comes and the river goes.” Up Rim Street now to River Road. He was halfway there. The singers were starting on “The Song of Darkness.” It was his favorite, with its powerful, deep harmonies—he was a little sorry to be missing it. He went up the Pott Street side of empty Riverroad Square, where another poster hung crookedly on the kiosk, and he was headed toward North Street when suddenly the lights flickered and went out. He jolted to a stop. Stand still and wait—that was his automatic response. In the distance he heard a dip in the sound of the singing, some startled voices breaking the flow, but then the song rose again, defying the darkness. For a moment all thoughts vanished from Doon’s mind; there was nothing but the fearless words of the song: “Black as sleep and deep as dreaming, Darkness like an endless night. Yet within the streets of Ember Bright and bravely shines our light.” He sang, standing still in the blackness. When the song ended, he waited. The lights would surely come back soon. For a few minutes there was silence, and then, far away but piercingly clear, he heard a scream. More screams and shouts followed, the sounds of panic. He felt the panic himself, like a hand taking hold of him, making him want to leap up and fling himself against the dark. But suddenly, with a flash of joy, he remembered: he didn’t have to wait for the lights to come back on. He had what no citizen of Ember had ever had before—a way to see in the dark. He set his pack down, untied the knot at the top, and groped around inside until he felt the candle. Down in a corner, he found the little packet of matches. He scraped a match against the pavement, and it flared up instantly. He held the flame to the string on the candle, and the string began to burn. He had a light. He had the only light in the entire city. The candle didn’t cast its light very far, but it was enough to see at least the pavement in front of him. He went slowly along Pott Street, then turned left on North Street. At the end of the street was the wall of the Pipeworks office. When he got to the Pipeworks entrance, no one was there. A little cloud of moths came to flutter around the flame of his candle, but otherwise nothing moved in Plummer Square. There was nothing to do but wait. Doon blew the candle out—he didn’t want to use it all up in case the lights stayed off a long time—and squatted down on the pavement, setting down his bundle and leaning against one of the big trash cans. He waited, listening to the distant shouts—and at last the lights blinked, blinked again, and came on. Lina was nowhere in sight. If the guards had found her and taken her…But Doon preferred not to think about that yet. He would wait for a while—she would have been delayed by the blackout if she was on her way. He couldn’t see the clock tower from here, but it was probably not quite four o’clock. What if she didn’t come? The Singing was over, the people were dispersing throughout the city, and the guards, no doubt, would soon resume their search for him. Doon clasped his arms together and pressed them hard against his stomach, trying to stop the queasy fluttering. If she didn’t come, Doon had two choices: he could stay in the city and do what he could to save Lina, or he could go in the boat by himself and hope Lina could somehow free herself and tell the people of Ember about the way out. He didn’t like either of these plans; he wanted to go down the river, and he wanted to go with Lina. Doon stood up and hoisted his sack again. He was too restless to keep sitting. He walked down to Gappery Street and looked in both directions. Not a single person was in sight. He walked to Plummer Street, thinking that perhaps Lina was coming by way of the city’s edge, as he had, to avoid being seen. But no one was there; he didn’t even see anyone when he went past Subling Street to the very end of the city. He had to decide what to do. He went and stood in the doorway of the Pipeworks. Think, he said to himself. Think! He was not even sure he could make the river journey by himself. How would he get the boat into the water? Could he lift it without help? On the other hand, how could he help Lina if she was in the hands of the mayor’s guards? What could he possibly do that would not just get himself caught, too? He felt sick. His hands were cold. He stepped out of the doorway and scanned the square once again. Nothing moved but the moths around the lights. And then down Gappery Street Lina came running. She came slantwise across the square, and he dashed to meet her. She was hugging a bundle to her chest. “I’ve come, I’m here, I almost didn’t make it,” she said, breathing so hard she could barely talk. “And look.” She folded back the blanket of her bundle. Doon saw a curl of brown hair and two wide frightened eyes. “I’ve brought Poppy.” Doon was so glad to see Lina that he didn’t mind at all that Poppy was coming with them, making a risky journey even riskier. Relief and excitement flooded through him. They were going! They were going! “Okay,” he said. “Come on!” With his borrowed key, he opened the Pipeworks door, and they hurried past the yellow slickers on their hooks and the lines of rubber boots. Doon dashed into the Pipeworks office long enough to replace the key on its hook, and then they pulled open the stairway door and started down. Lina stepped slowly because of Poppy, and Poppy clung to her neck, unusually quiet, sensing the strangeness and importance of what was happening. At the bottom of the stairs, they came out into the main tunnel and walked down the path to the west until they came to the marked rock. “How are we going to get Poppy down there?” Doon asked. Lina said, “I’ll fasten her to my chest.” Setting Poppy down, Lina took off the coat and the sweater she was wearing. With Doon’s help, she made her sweater into a sling for Poppy, tying its sleeves behind her neck. Then she put her coat back on and buttoned it up. Doon looked doubtfully at this bulky arrangement. “Will you be able to climb down, carrying her like that? Will you be able to reach around her and hold on to the rungs?” “Yes,” said Lina. Now that she had Poppy with her, she felt brave again. She could do whatever she needed to. Doon went down first. Lina followed. “Stay very still, Poppy,” she said. “Don’t squirm.” Poppy did stay still, but even so it was not easy going down the ladder with her extra weight. Lina’s arms were just long enough to reach past Poppy and hold on to the ladder. She descended very slowly. When she got to the ledge, she stepped sideways, gripped the hand Doon held out for her, and, with a deep breath of relief, came into the entryway. They walked to the back of the entry hall, and Doon opened the steel panel and took out the key. He slid aside the door to the room where the single boat was, and they went in. Doon took his candle from his sack and lit it. Lina unwrapped Poppy and sat her down at the back of the room. “Don’t move from there,” she said. Poppy put her thumb in her mouth, and Doon and Lina set to work. Doon’s sack went in the pointed end of the boat, which they decided must be the front. They put the boxes of candles and matches into the rear of the boat. It was clear they’d been designed to go there; they fit snugly. The poles labeled “Paddles” were a mystery. Lina thought maybe they were weapons, meant for fending off hostile creatures. Doon thought they might fit across the boat somehow to make railings to brace yourself against, but he couldn’t get them to work in this way. Finally they decided just to leave the paddles in the bottom of the boat and figure out what they were for as they went along. Doon dripped a bit of wax on the floor and stood his candle up in it, so he’d have both hands free. “Let’s see if we can lift the boat,” he said. With Doon at the rear and Lina at the front, they found they could lift the boat with ease. It was amazingly light, even with the boxes and pack inside it. They set it down again. The next step was to get it in the water somehow, and then get in it themselves. “We can’t just drop it in,” Lina said. “The river would grab it right away.” “That must be what the ropes are for,” said Doon. “We lower it in by holding on to the ropes. And tie the ropes to something to keep it from moving.” “To what?” “They must have put a peg or something in the wall to tie it to.” Doon went back out to the edge of the river and got down on his knees. Leaning over, he felt with one hand along the bank below. At first there was only smooth, slippery rock. He moved his hand slowly back and forth, up and down. River water splashed against his fingers. At last he felt something—a metal rod attached to the river wall, like the rungs of the ladder they had climbed down. “I’ve found it,” he called. He got up again and went back to the boat room. “Let’s carry the boat out,” he said. He and Lina lifted it and, taking small steps, moved it forward. As they went out the door, Poppy began to wail. “Don’t cry!” Lina called to her. “Stay right there! We’ll be back in a second.” They carried the boat right to the edge of the water and set it down carefully, its front end pointing downstream. Doon knelt again, feeling for the metal rod. “Hand me the end of the rope,” he said. Which rope? Lina thought for a second. She realized it had to be the one attached to the side of the boat nearest her—that would be the side closest to the riverbank when they put the boat in. She uncoiled the rope, ran it around the boat, and handed its end down to Doon, who lay on his stomach with his head hanging over the edge and knotted the rope to the metal rung in the wall. He got to his feet again, wiping water from his face. “Now,” Doon said, “we can put the boat in the water.” Another wail came from the boat room. “I’m coming,” Lina called, and dashed back for Poppy. She hoisted her up and spoke into her ear, in the voice she used for announcing an exciting game: “We’re going on an adventure, Poppy. We’re going for a ride, a ride in the water! It will be fun, sweetie, you’ll see.” She blew out the candle Doon had left and carried Poppy to the river’s edge. “Are we ready?” said Doon. “I guess we are.” Goodbye to Ember, Lina thought. Goodbye to everyone, goodbye to everything. For a second, a picture of herself arriving in the bright city of her dreams flashed into her mind, and then it faded and was gone. She had no idea what lay ahead. She set Poppy down against the wall of the entry passage. “Sit here,” she told her. “Don’t move until I tell you to.” Poppy sat, her eyes wide, her plump legs sticking out in front of her. Lina took hold of the rope at the rear of the boat. Doon took hold of the rope at the front. They heaved the boat up and stretched sideways to swing it out over the water. It tipped alarmingly from side to side. “Let it down!” yelled Lina. They both let the ropes slide through their hands, and the boat fell and hit the water with a slap. It bounced and rocked and pulled against its tether, but Doon’s knot held. The boat stayed in place, waiting for them. “Here I go!” Doon cried. He bent over, gripped the rim of the boat with one hand, turned backward, and stepped in. The boat tipped sideways under his weight. Doon staggered a step, and then found his balance. “All right!” he yelled. “Hand me Poppy!” Lina lifted Poppy, who began to howl and kick at the sight of the bucking boat and the churning water. But Doon’s arms were right there, and Lina thrust her into them. A second later, she jumped in herself, and then all three of them were tossed to the floor of the boat by its violent rocking. Doon managed to get to his feet. He hauled on the rope that held the boat to the bank until he was close enough to reach the knot. He struggled with it. Water splashed into his face. He yanked at the knot, loosened it, pulled the rope free—and the boat shot forward."
City of Ember Chapter 18,"For a second, Lina saw the banks of the river streak by. Ahead was the opening of the tunnel, like an enormous mouth. They plunged into it and left the light of the Pipeworks behind. In complete darkness, the boat pitched and rolled, and Lina, in the bottom of it, banged from side to side, gripping Poppy with one arm and grabbing with the other hand for anything to hold on to. Doon slid into her, and she slid into the boxes. Poppy was shrieking wildly. “Doon!” Lina shouted, and he shouted back, “Hold on! Hold on!” But she kept losing her grip on the edge of the boat and being flung sideways. She was terrified that Poppy would slam into the metal bench, or be torn from her arms and tossed into the river. The boat hit something and shuddered, then raced on. It felt like being swallowed, this rushing through the dark, with the river roaring like a thousand voices. Lina’s legs were tangled with Doon’s, and Poppy’s arms were so tight around her neck that she could hardly breathe. But it was the dark that was most terrible—going so fast into the dark. She closed her eyes. If they were going to smash into a wall or plunge into a bottomless hole, there was nothing she could do about it. All she could do was hold tight to Poppy. She did that, for what seemed a long time. And then at last the current slowed, and the boat stopped thrashing about so wildly. Lina managed to sit up, and she felt Doon moving, too. Poppy’s shrieks turned to whimpers. The darkness was still complete, but Lina sensed space above and around her. Where were they? She had to see. “Doon!” she said. “Are you all right? Can you find us a candle?” “I’ll try,” Doon said. She felt him scramble past her to the back of the boat, and she heard a scrape as he pulled a box out from its place under the bench. “Can’t find the latch!” Doon said. Then a second later, “There, I’ve got it. This is the matches, so this one must be candles.” More scraping and banging. The boat lurched, Lina slid forward. Doon slid, too, and slammed into her back. He gave a yell of rage. “Dropped the match! Hold on, I almost had it.” Long seconds of scrambling and clattering. Then a light flared up, and Doon’s shadowed face appeared above it. He touched the match to a candle, and the light grew steadier. It was only a small flame, but it cast glints of light on the tunnel walls and the silky surface of the water. The tunnel had an arched ceiling, Lina saw, like the tunnels of the Pipeworks, but it was much wider than those tunnels. The river ran through it like a moving road. “Can you light another?” Lina asked. Doon nodded and turned back to the boxes, but once again the boat struck something, causing a spray of water to slap into them and put the candle out. It was several minutes before Doon managed to light it again, and more before he finally had two burning at once. He jammed one of them into a space between the bench and the side of the boat, and he held the other in his hand. His hair was flattened against his forehead, and dripping. His brown jacket was torn at the shoulder. “That’s better,” he said. It was better—not only did they have light to see by, but the current was slower, and the boat sailed more smoothly. Lina was able to unwrap Poppy from her neck and look around. Ahead she could see that the tunnel curved. The boat swung into the curve, banged against the wall, straightened itself, and sped on. “Hand me a candle, too,” she said. Doon gave Lina the candle he was holding and lit another. They found places to wedge all three candles into the frame of the boat, so they could keep their hands free. For a while they rushed along almost silently, the river having become nearly as smooth as a sheet of glass. Then suddenly the current slowed even more, and the tunnel opened out. “We’ve come into a room,” said Lina. Far overhead arched a vaulted ceiling. Columns of rock hung down from it, and columns of rock rose from the water, too, making long shadows that turned and mingled as the boat floated among them. They glimmered in the candlelight, pink and pale green and silver. Their strange lumpy shapes looked like something soft that had frozen—like towers of mashed potatoes, Lina thought, that had hardened to stone. Now and then the boat bumped into one of these columns, and they found that they could use a paddle to knock themselves free again. In this way they crossed the room to the other side, where again the passage narrowed and the current ran faster. Much faster. It was as if the boat were being pulled forward by a powerful hand. The water grew rough again, and splashes of spray put out their candles. Lina and Doon huddled in the bottom of the boat with Poppy between them, their arms clasped around her. They clenched their teeth and squeezed their eyes shut, and soon there was nothing in their minds but the roll and plunge of the boat and nothing in their bodies but the effort not to be thrown out. Once, the sound of the river rose to a crashing, and the front of the boat tipped downward, and they were pitched about so violently that it seemed they were tumbling down stairs—but that lasted only a few seconds, and then they were streaming onward as before. Lina lost track of time. But a while later, maybe a few minutes, maybe an hour, the current slowed. The candles they’d stuck in the boat had been knocked overboard, so Doon lit new ones. They saw that they had come to another pool. There were no lumpy columns of rock here; nothing interrupted the wide flat surface of the water, which stretched out before them in the flickering light from their candles. The ceiling was smooth and only about ten feet above their heads. The boat drifted, as if it had lost its sense of direction. Using a paddle to poke against the walls, Doon guided the boat around the edge of the pool. “I don’t see where the river goes on,” said Doon. “Do you?” “No,” said Lina. “Unless it’s there, where it flows into that little gap.” She pointed to a crack in the wall only a few inches wide. “But the boat can’t go there.” “No, it’s much too small.” He poled the boat forward. Their shadows moved with them along the wall. “Wanna go home,” said Poppy. “We’re almost there,” Lina told her. “We certainly can’t go back the way we came,” said Doon. “No.” Lina dipped a hand in the water. It was so cold it sent an ache up her arm. “Could this be the end?” said Doon. His voice sounded flat in this closed-in place. “The end?” Lina felt a shiver of fear. “I mean the end of the trip,” Doon said. “Maybe we’re supposed to get out over there.” He pointed to a wide expanse of rock that sloped back into the darkness on one side of the pool. Everywhere else, the walls rose straight out of the water. He poled the boat over to the rock slope. The boat scraped bottom here—the water was shallow. “I’ll get out and see if this goes anywhere,” said Lina. “I want to be on solid ground again, anyway.” She handed Poppy to Doon and stood up. Holding a candle, she put one foot over the edge of the boat and into the cold water, and she waded ashore. The way did not look promising. The ground sloped upward, and the ceiling sloped downward. As she went farther back she had to stoop. A few yards in, a tumbled heap of rocks blocked the way. She inched around them, turning sideways to squeeze through the narrow space, and crept forward, holding the candle out in front of her. This goes nowhere, she thought. We’re trapped. But a few steps farther along, she found she could stand up straight again, and a few steps beyond that she turned a corner, and suddenly the candlelight shone on a wide path, with a high ceiling and a smooth floor. Lina gave a wild shout. “Here it is!” she cried. “It’s here! There’s a path!” Doon’s voice came from far away. She couldn’t tell what he was saying. She made her way back toward the boat, and when it came in sight she yelled again, “I found a path! A path!” Doon scrambled out and waded ashore, carrying Poppy. He set her down, and then he and Lina took hold of the boat and hauled it as far as they could up the slope of rock. Poppy caught the excitement. She shouted gleefully, waving her fists like little clubs, and stomped around, glad to be on her feet again. She found a pebble and plunked it into the water, crowing happily at the splash it made. “I want to see the path,” said Doon. “Go up that way,” Lina told him, “and around the pile of rocks. I’ll stay here and take things out of the boat.” Doon went, taking another candle from the box in the boat. Lina sat Poppy down in a kind of nook formed by a roundish boulder and a hollow in the wall. “Don’t move from here,” she said. Then she pulled Doon’s bundle from under the seat of the boat. It was damp, but not soaked. Maybe the food inside would still be all right. She was hungry all of a sudden. She’d had no dinner, she remembered. It must be the middle of the night by now, or maybe even morning again. She carried Doon’s bundle ashore, along with the boxes of candles and matches, and as she set them down, Doon came back. His eyes were glowing, the reflection of a tiny flame dancing in each one. “That’s it for sure,” he said. “We’ve made it.” Then his eyes shifted. “What’s Poppy got?” he asked. Lina whipped around. In Poppy’s hands was something dark and rectangular. It wasn’t a stone. It was more like a packet of some kind. She was plucking and pulling at it. She lifted it to her mouth as if to tear it with her teeth—and Lina jumped to her feet. “Stop!” she shouted. Poppy, startled, dropped the packet and began to cry. “It’s all right, never mind,” Lina said, retrieving what Poppy had been about to chew on. “Come and have some dinner now. Hush, we’re going to have dinner. I’m sure you’re hungry.” In the light of Doon’s candle, with Poppy squirming on Lina’s lap, they examined Poppy’s find. The packet was wrapped in slippery, greenish material and bound up with a strap. It wasn’t wrapped very well; it looked as if someone had bundled it up quickly. The material was loose, and blotched with whitish mold. Lina edged the strap off carefully. It was partly rotten; on the end of it was a small square buckle, covered with rust. She folded back the wrapping. Doon took a sharp breath. “It’s a book,” he said. He moved his candle closer, and Lina opened the brown cover. The pages inside had faint blue lines across them, and someone had written along these lines in slanted black letters, which were not neat like the writing in the library books, but sprawling, as if the writer had been in a hurry. Doon ran his finger under the first line. “It says, They tell us we…learn?…No, leave. They tell us we leave tonight.” He looked up and met Lina’s eyes. “Leave?” said Lina. “From where?” “From Ember?” Doon asked. “Could someone have come this way before us?” “Or was it someone leaving the other city?” Doon looked down at the book again. He riffled through the pages—there were many of them. “Let’s save it,” said Lina. “We’ll read it when we get to the new city.” Doon nodded. “It’ll be easier to see there.” So Lina wrapped up the book again and tied it securely into Doon’s bundle. They sat on the rock shelf for a while, eating the food Doon had brought. The candles wedged in the boat still shone steadily, and their light was cozy, like lamplight. It made golden shapes on the still surface of the pond. Doon said, “I saw the guards run after you. Tell me what happened.” Lina told him. “And what about Poppy? What did you tell Mrs. Murdo?” “I told her the truth—at least I hope it’s the truth. I caught up with her on her way home after the Singing. She’d seen the posters—she was terrified—but before she could ask questions, I just said she must give Poppy to me. I said I was taking her to safety. Because that’s what I suddenly realized on the roof of the Gathering Hall, Doon. I’d been thinking before that I had to leave Poppy because she’d be safe with Mrs. Murdo. But when the lights went out, I suddenly knew: There is no safety in Ember. Not for long. Not for anyone. I couldn’t leave her behind. Whatever happens to us now, it’s better than what’s going to happen there.” “And did you explain all that to Mrs. Murdo?” “No. I was in a terrible hurry to get to the Pipeworks and meet you, and I knew I had to go while there were still crowds in the street, so it would be harder for the guards to see me. I just said I was taking Poppy to safety. Mrs. Murdo handed her over, but she sort of sputtered, ‘Where?’ and ‘Why?’ And I said, ‘You’ll know in a few days—it’s all right.’ And then I ran.” “So you gave her the note, then?” said Doon. “The one meant for Clary?” “Oh!” Lina stared at him, stricken. “The message to Clary!” She put her hand in her pocket and pulled out the crumpled piece of paper. “I forgot all about it! All I was thinking of was getting Poppy and getting to you.” “So no one knows about the room full of boats.” Lina just shook her head, her eyes wide. “How will we get back to tell them?” “We can’t.” “Doon,” said Lina, “if we’d told people right away, even just a few people…if we hadn’t decided to be grand and announce it at the Singing…” “I know,” said Doon. “But we didn’t, that’s all. We didn’t tell, and now no one knows. I did leave a message for my father, though.” He told Lina about pinning his last-minute message to the kiosk in Selverton Square. “I said we’d found the way out, and that it was in the Pipeworks. But that’s not much help.” “Clary has seen the Instructions,” Lina said. “She knows there’s an egress. She might find it.” “Or she might not.” There was nothing to be done about it, and so they put the supplies back into Doon’s pillowcase and got ready to go. Lina used Doon’s rope to make a leash for Poppy. She tied one end around Poppy’s waist and the other around her own. She filled her pockets with packs of matches, and Doon put all the remaining candles in his sack—in case they arrived in the new city at night. He filled his bottle with river water, lit a candle for himself and one for Lina, and thus equipped, they left the boat behind and crept up the rocky shelf to the path."
City of Ember Chapter 19,"As they squeezed past the rocks at the entrance to the path, Doon thought he saw the candlelight glance off a shiny place on the wall. He stopped to look, and when he saw what it was, he called out to Lina, who was a few steps ahead of him. “There’s a notice!” It was a framed sign, bolted to the stone, a printed sheet behind a piece of glass. Dampness had seeped under the glass and made splotches on the paper, but by holding their candles up close, they could read it. Welcome, Refugees from Ember! This is the final stage of your journey. Be prepared for a climb that will take several hours. Fill your bottles with water from the river. We wish you good fortune, The Builders “They’re expecting us!” said Lina. “Well, they wrote this a long time ago,” Doon said. “The people who put it here must all be dead by now.” “That’s true. But they wished us good fortune. It makes me feel as if they’re watching over us.” “Yes. And maybe their great-great-great-grandchildren will be there to welcome us.” Encouraged, they started up the path. Their candles made only a feeble glow, but they could tell that the path was quite wide. The ceiling was high over their heads. The path seemed to have been made for a great company of people. In some places, the ground beneath their feet was rutted in parallel grooves, as if a wheeled cart of some kind had been driven over it. After they had walked awhile, they realized that they were moving in long zigzags. The path would go in one direction for some time and then turn sharply and go the opposite way. As they went along, they talked less and less; the path sloped relentlessly upward, and they needed their breath just for breathing. The only sound was the light pat-pat of their footsteps. Lina and Doon took turns carrying Poppy on their backs—she had gotten tired of walking very soon and cried to be picked up. Twice, they stopped and sat down to rest, leaning against the walls of the passage and taking drinks from Doon’s bottle of water. “How many hours do you think we’ve been walking?” Lina asked. “I don’t know,” Doon said. “Maybe two. Maybe three. We must be nearly there.” They climbed on and on. Their first candles had long ago burned down to the last inch, as had their second candles. Finally, when their third ones were about halfway gone, Lina began to notice that the air smelled different. The cold, sharp-edged rock smell of the tunnel was changing to something softer, a strange, lovely smell. As they rounded a corner, a gust of this soft air swept past them, and their candles went out. Doon said, “I’ll find a match,” but Lina said, “No, wait. Look.” They were not in complete darkness. A faint haze of light shone in the passage ahead of them. “It’s the lights of the city,” breathed Lina. Lina set Poppy down. “Quick, Poppy,” she said, and Poppy began to trot, keeping close at Lina’s heels. The strange, lovely smell in the air grew stronger. The passage came to an end a few yards farther along, and before them was an opening like a great empty doorway. Without a word, Lina and Doon took hold of each other’s hands, and Lina took hold of Poppy’s. When they stood in the doorway and looked out, they saw no new city at all, but something infinitely stranger: a land vast and spacious beyond any of their dreams, filled with air that seemed to move, and lit by a shining silver circle hanging in an immense black sky. In front of their feet, the ground swept away in a long, gentle slope. It was not bare stone, as in Ember; something soft covered it, like silvery hair, as high as their knees. Down the slope was a tumble of dark, rounded shapes, and then another slope rose beyond that. Way off into the distance, as far as they could see, the land lay in rolling swells, with clumps of shadow in the low places between them. “Doon!” cried Lina. “More lights!” She pointed at the sky. He looked up and saw them—hundreds and hundreds of tiny flecks of light, strewn like spilled salt across the blackness. “Oh!” he whispered. There was nothing else to say. The beauty of these lights made his breath stop in his throat. They took a few steps forward. Doon bent to feel the strands that grew out of the ground, almost higher than Poppy’s head; they were cool and smooth and soft, and there was dampness on them. “Breathe,” said Lina. She opened her mouth and took in a long breath of air. Doon did the same. “It’s sweet,” he said. “So full of smells.” They held their hands out to feel the long stems as they waded slowly through them. The air moved against their faces and in their hair. “Hear those sounds?” said Doon. A high, thin chirruping sound came from somewhere nearby. It was repeated over and over, like a question. “Yes,” said Lina. “What could it be?” “Something alive, I think. Maybe some kind of bug.” “A bug that sings.” Lina turned to Doon. Her face was shadowy in the silver light. “It’s so strange here, Doon, and so huge. But I’m not afraid.” “No. I’m not either. It feels like a dream.” “A dream, yes. Maybe that’s why it feels familiar. I might have dreamed about this place.” They walked until they came to where the dark shapes billowed up from the ground. These were plants, they discovered, taller than they were, with stems as hard and thick as the walls of houses, and leaves that spread out over their heads. On the slope beside these plants, they sat down. “Do you think there is a city here somewhere?” Lina asked. “Or any people at all?” “I don’t see any lights,” Doon said, “even far off.” “But with this silver lamp in the sky, maybe they don’t need lights.” Doon shook his head doubtfully. “People would need more light than this,” he said. “How could you see well enough to work? How could you grow your food? It’s a beautiful light, but not bright enough to live by.” “Then what shall we do, if there’s no city, and no people?” “I don’t know. I don’t know.” Doon didn’t feel like thinking. He was tired of figuring things out. He wanted to look at this new world, and take in the scent of it and the feel of it, and figure things out later. Lina felt the same way. She stopped asking questions, drew Poppy onto her lap, and gazed in silence at the glimmering landscape. After a while, she became aware that something strange was happening. Surely, when she had first sat down, the silver circle was just above the highest branch of the tall plant. Now the branch cut across it. As she watched, the circle sank very slowly down, until it was hidden, except for a gleam of brightness, behind the leaves. “It’s moving,” she said to Doon. “Yes.” A little later, it seemed to her that her eyes were blurring. There was a fuzziness in the sky, especially around the edges. It took a while for her to realize what was making the fuzziness. “Light,” she said. “I see it,” said Doon. “It’s getting brighter.” The edge of the sky turned gray, and then pale orange, and then deep fiery crimson. The land stood out against it, a long black rolling line. One spot along this line grew so bright they could hardly look at it, so bright it seemed to take a bite out of the land. It rose higher and higher until they could see that it was a fiery circle, first deep orange and then yellow, and too bright to look at any longer. The color seeped out of the sky and washed over the land. Light sparkled on the soft hair of the hills and shone through the lacy leaves as every shade of green sprang to life around them. They lifted their faces to the astonishing warmth. The sky arched over them, higher than they could have imagined, a pale, clear blue. Lina felt as though a lid that had been on her all her life had been lifted off. Light and air rushed through her, making a song, like the songs of Ember, only it was a song of joy. She looked at Doon and saw that he was smiling and crying at the same time, and she realized that she was, too. Everything around them was springing to life. A glorious racket came from the branches—tweedling notes, peeps, burbles, high sharp calls. Bugs? wondered Doon, imagining with awe the bugs that could make such sounds. But then he saw something fly from a cluster of leaves and swoop down low across the ground, making a clear, sweet call as it flew. “Did you see that?” he said to Lina, pointing. “And there’s another one! And there!” “There there there there!” repeated Poppy, leaping from Lina’s lap and whirling around, pointing in every direction. The air was full of them now. They were much too large to be insects. One of them lit nearby on a stem. It looked at them with two bright black eyes and, opening its mouth, which was pointed like a thorn, sent forth a little trill. “It’s speaking to us,” said Doon. “What could it be?” Lina just shook her head. The little creature shifted its clawlike feet on the stem, flapped its brown wings, and trilled again. Then it leapt into the air and was gone. They leapt up, too, and threw themselves into exploration. The ground was alive with insects—so many that Doon just laughed in helpless wonder. Flowers bloomed among the green blades, and a stream ran at the foot of the hill. They roamed over the green-coated slopes, running, sliding, calling out to each other with each new discovery, until they were exhausted. Then they sat down by the entrance to the path to eat what was left of their food. They untied Doon’s bundle, and Lina suddenly cried out. “The book! We forgot about the book!” There it was, wrapped in its blotched green cloth. “Let’s read it out loud while we eat,” said Doon. Lina opened the fragile notebook and laid it on the ground in front of her. She picked up a carrot with one hand, and with the other she kept her place on the scribbled page. This is what she read."
City of Ember Chapter 20,"Friday They tell us we leave tonight. I knew it would be soon—the training has been over for nearly a month now—but still it feels sudden, it feels like a shock. Why did I agree to do this? I am an old woman, too tired to take up a new life. I wish now that I’d said no when they asked me. I have put everything I can into my one suitcase—clothes, shoes, a good wind-up clock, some soap, an extra pair of glasses. Bring no books, they said, and no photographs. We have been told to say nothing, ever again, about the world we come from. But I am going to take this notebook anyhow. I am determined to write down what happens. Someday, someone may need to know. Saturday I went to the train station yesterday evening, as they told me to, and got on the train they told me to take. It took us through Spring Valley, and I gazed out the window at the fields and houses of the place I was saying goodbye to—my home, and my family’s home for generations. I rode for two hours, until the train reached a station in the hills. When I arrived, they met me—three men in suits—and drove me to a large building, where they led me down a corridor and into a big room full of other people—all with suitcases, most with gray or white hair. Here we have been waiting now for more than an hour. They have spent years and years making this plan. It’s supposed to ensure that, no matter what happens, people won’t disappear from the earth. Some say that will never happen anyhow. I’m not so sure. Disaster seems very close. Everything will be all right, they tell us, but only a few people believe them. Why, if it’s going to be all right, do we see it getting worse every day? And of course this plan is proof that they think the world is doomed. All the best scientists and engineers have been pulled in to work on it. Extraordinary efforts have been made—efforts that would have done more good elsewhere. I think it’s the wrong answer. But they asked me if I would go—I suppose because I’ve spent my life on a farm and I know about growing food. In spite of my doubts, I said yes. I’m not sure why. There are a hundred of us, fifty men and fifty women. We are all at least sixty years old. There will be a hundred babies, too—two babies for each pair of “parents.” I don’t know yet which one of these gentlemen I’ll be matched with. We are all strangers to one another. They planned it that way; they said there would be fewer memories between us. They want us to forget everything about the lives we’ve led and the places we’ve lived. The babies must grow up with no knowledge of a world outside, so that they feel no sorrow for what they have lost. I hear some noises across the room. I think it’s the babies arriving.… Yes, here they come, each being carried by one of those gray-suited men. So many of them! So small! Little scrunched-up faces, tiny fists waving. I must stop for now. They’re going to pass them out. Later We’re traveling again, on a bus this time. It is night, I think, though it’s hard to be sure because they have boarded up the windows of the bus from the outside. They don’t want us to know where we’re going. I have a baby on my lap—a girl. She has a bright pink face and no hair at all. Stanley, who sits next to me, holds a boy baby, with brown skin and a few tufts of black hair. Stanley and I are the keepers of these children. Our task is to raise them in this new place we’re going to. By the time they are twenty or so, we’ll be gone. They’ll be on their own, making a new world. Stanley and I have named these children Star and Forest. Sunday The buses have stopped, but they have not allowed us to get out yet. I can hear crickets singing, and smell the grass, so we must be in the country, and it must be night. I am very tired. What kind of place can this be, safe from earthly catastrophes? All I can guess is that it must be underground. The thought fills me with dread. I’ll try to sleep a little now. Later There was no chance to sleep. They called us off the buses, and we stepped out into a landscape of rolling hills, in full moonlight. “That’s the way we’ll be going in,” they told us, pointing to a dark opening in the hill we stood on. “Form a line there, please.” We did so. It was very quiet, except for the squalling of a few of the babies. If the others were like me, they were saying goodbye to the world. I reached down to touch the grass and breathed deeply to smell the earth. My eyes swept over the silver hills, and I thought of the animals prowling softly in the shadows or sleeping in their burrows, and the birds standing beneath the leaves of the trees, with their heads tucked under their wings. Last, I raised my eyes to the moon, which smiled down on us from a long, cold distance away. The moon will still be here when they come out, I thought. The moon and the hills, at least. The opening led us into a winding passage that ran steeply downhill for perhaps a mile. It was hard going for me; my legs are not strong anymore. We moved very slowly. The last part was the worst: a rocky slope where it was easy to miss your footing and slip. This led down to a pool. By the shore of the pool our group of aged pioneers gathered. Motorboats were waiting here for us, equipped with lanterns. “When it’s time for people to leave this place, is this the way they will come?” I asked our pilot, who has a kind face. He said yes. “But how will they know there’s a way out, if no one tells them?” I said. “How will they know what to do?” “They’re going to have instructions,” said the pilot. “They won’t be able to get at the instructions until the time is right. But when they need them, the instructions will be there.” “But what if they don’t find them? What if they never come out again?” “I think they will. People find a way through just about anything.” That was all he would say. I am writing these notes while our pilot loads the boat. I hope he doesn’t notice. “It ends there,” said Lina, looking up. “He must have noticed,” said Doon. “Or she was afraid he would, so she decided to hide it instead of taking it with her.” “She must have hoped someone would find it.” “Just as we did.” He pondered. “But we might not have, if it hadn’t been for Poppy.” “No. And we wouldn’t have known that we came from here.” The fiery circle had moved up in the sky now, and the air was so warm that they took off their coats. Absently, Doon dug his finger into the ground, which was soft and crumbly. “But what was the disaster that happened in this place?” he said. “It doesn’t look ruined to me.” “It must have happened a long, long time ago,” said Lina. “I wonder if people still live here.” They sat looking out over the hills, thinking of the woman who had written in the notebook. What had her city been like? Lina wondered. Like Ember in some way, she imagined. A city with trouble, where people argued over solutions. A dying city. But it was hard to picture a city like Ember here in this bright, beautiful place. How could anyone have allowed such a place to be harmed? “What do we do now?” asked Lina. She wrapped the notebook in its covering again and set it aside. “We can’t go back up the river and tell them all to come here.” “No. We could never make the boat go against that current.” “Are we here alone, then, forever?” “Maybe there’s another way in, some way that lets you walk down to Ember. Or maybe there’s another river that runs the other way. We have candles now, we could cross the Unknown Regions if we found a way to get there.” This was the only plan they could come up with. So, all day long, they searched for another way in. Under the brow of the hill, they found a hole where a stream wandered into the dark. The water was good to drink, but the hole was far too small for them to fit through. There were gullies full of shrubs, and Lina and Doon crawled among the leaves and prickly branches, but found no openings. Bugs buzzed around their ankles and past their eyes; brown earth stained their hands, and pebbles got into their shoes. Their thick, dark, shabby clothes got all full of prickly things, and since they were much too hot anyhow, they took most of them off. They had never felt such warmth against their skin and such soft air. When the bright circle was at the top of the sky, they sat for a while in the shade of one of the tall plants on the side of the hill, in a place where the thick brush gave way to a clearing. Poppy went to sleep, but Lina and Doon sat looking out over the land. Green was everywhere, in different shades, like a huge, brilliant, gorgeous version of the overlapping carpets back in the rooms of Ember. Far away, Lina saw a narrow gray line curving like a pencil stroke across a sweep of green. She pointed this out to Doon, and both of them squinted hard at it, but it was too far away to see clearly. “Could it be a road?” said Lina. “It could,” said Doon. “Maybe there are people here after all.” “I hope so,” said Doon. “There’s so much I want to know.” They were still gazing at the far-off bit of gray when they heard something moving in the brush nearby. Leaves rustled. There was a scraping, shuffling sound. They stiffened and held their breath. The shuffling paused, then started up again. Was it a person? Should they call out? But before they could decide what to do, a creature stepped into the clearing. It was about the same size as Poppy, only lower to the ground, because it walked on four legs instead of two. Its fur was a deep rust-red. Its face was a long triangle, its ears stood up in points, and its black eyes shone. It trotted forward a few steps, absorbed in its own business. Behind it floated a thick, soft-looking tail. All at once it saw them and stopped. Lina and Doon stayed absolutely still. So did the creature. Then it took a step toward them, paused, tilted its head a little as if to get a better look, and took another step. They could see the sheen of its fur and the glint of light in its eyes. For a long moment, they stayed like this, frozen, staring at one another. Then, unhurriedly, the creature moved away. It pushed its nose among the leaves on the ground, wandering back toward the bushes, and when it raised its head again, they saw that it was holding something in its white teeth, something round and purplish. With a last glance at them, it leapt toward the bushes, its tail sailing, and disappeared. Lina let out her breath and turned to look at Doon, whose mouth was open in astonishment. His voice shaky, he said, “That was the most wonderful thing I have ever seen, ever in my whole life.” “Yes.” “And it saw us,” Doon said, and Lina nodded. They both felt it—they had been seen. The creature was utterly strange, not like anything they had ever known, and yet when it looked at them, some kind of recognition passed between them. “I know now,” said Doon. “This is the world we belong in.” — A few minutes later, Poppy woke up and made fretful noises, and Lina gave her the last of the peas in Doon’s pack. “What was that, do you think, in the creature’s mouth?” she asked. “Would it be something we could eat, a fruit of some kind? It looked like the pictures of peaches on cans, except for the color.” They got up and poked around, and soon they came across a plant whose branches were laden with the purple fruits, about the size of small beets, only softer. Doon picked one and cut it open with his knife. There was a stone inside. Red juice ran out over his hands. Cautiously, he touched his tongue to it. “Sweet,” he said. “If the creature can eat it, maybe we can, too,” said Lina. “Shall we?” They did. Nothing had ever tasted better. Lina cut the stones out and gave chunks of the fruit to Poppy. Juice ran down their chins. When they had eaten five or six apiece, they licked their sticky fingers clean and started to explore again. They went higher up the slope they were on, wading through flowers as high as their waists, and near the top they came upon a kind of dent in the ground, as if a bit of the earth had caved in. They walked down into it, and at the end of the dent they found a crack about as tall as a person but not nearly as wide as a door. Lina edged through it sideways and discovered a narrow tunnel. “Send Poppy through,” she called back to Doon, “and come yourself.” But it was dark inside, and Doon had to go back to where he’d left his pack to get a candle. By candlelight, they crept along until they came to a place where the tunnel ended abruptly. But it ended not with a wall but with a sudden huge nothingness that made them gasp and step back. A few feet beyond their shoes was a sheer, dizzying drop. They looked out into a cave so enormous that it seemed almost as big as the world outside. Far down at the bottom shone a cluster of lights. “It’s Ember,” Lina whispered. They could see the tiny bright streets crossing each other, and the squares, little chips of light, and the dark tops of buildings. Just beyond the edges was the immense darkness. “Oh, our city, Doon. Our city is at the bottom of a hole!” She gazed down through the gulf, and all of what she had believed about the world began to slowly break apart. “We were underground,” she said. “Not just the Pipeworks. Everything!” She could hardly make sense of what she was saying. Doon crouched on his hands and knees, looking over the edge. He squinted, trying to see minute specks that might be people. “What’s happening there, I wonder?” “Could they hear us if we shouted?” “I don’t think so. We’re much too far up.” “Maybe if they looked into the sky they’d see our candle,” said Lina. “But no, I guess they wouldn’t. The streetlamps would be too bright.” “Somehow, we have to get word to them,” said Doon, and that was when the idea came to Lina. “Our message!” she cried. “We could send our message!” And they did. From her pocket, Lina took the message that Doon had written, the one that was supposed to have gone to Clary, explaining everything. In small writing, they squeezed in this note at the top: Dear People of Ember, We came down the river from the Pipeworks and found the way to another place. It is green here and very big. Light comes from the sky. You must follow the instructions in this message and come on the river. Bring food with you. Come as quickly as you can. Lina Mayfleet and Doon Harrow They wrapped the message in Doon’s shirt and put a rock inside it. Then they stood in a row at the edge of the chasm, Doon in the middle holding Poppy’s hand and Lina’s. Lina took aim at the heart of the city, far beneath her feet. With all her strength, she cast the message into the darkness, and they watched as it plunged down and down."
